47257,21,Fri,Jan,2022,05:37:33,Fallout 76,"I know this game was a disaster at launch. I bought it a couple months ago on sale and in my opinion it was entirely worth the price, in fact I think I would have paid more for it knowing how much I have enjoyed it now. If you enjoyed the exploration side of Fallout 4, just roaming the wastelands with the radio on discovering new locations, clearing the enemies, looting scraps and new upgrades, then you will absolutely enjoy this game. 

Think of Fallout 4 but make it much harder to upgrade your gear, you need to learn the plans to create and modify weapons/armor, the only way to learn those plans is either to find them in the world, a random chance to learn them when scrapping identical gear, or purchasing them with caps. This makes progression a lot more satisfying because of the challenge, it takes time and effort to gear out, unlike F4. Plans are also relatively expensive, especially the good ones, giving actual value to caps in this game. It has a very similar leveling system to Fallout 4's perks, but instead of permanent upgrades, it's cards that you earn with the perks in them, they can be leveled, maxed, and swapped out for alternate builds.  You can pick a new card every time you level up or chose to upgrade a card you have, you also earn card packs as rewards throughout your playthrough. It also takes ideas from Survival mode in Fallout 4, making it that you need food and water to survive(no sleep required) and that you can catch diseases and mutations.

If you like building settlements then you will like the camp system. Think of it as your one main settlement, you can relocate it cheaply whenever you want. Your camp will look like crap at first, but once you start purchasing and learning new plans it will really start to shape up into a nice camp and this progression is very satisfying. In Fallout 4 you had just about everything you needed from the start, in 76 you need to earn those plans, it makes it much more rewarding. I do wish you could have more then one unique NPC at once at your camp, I also wish you could use them as a follower while you wander.

An original complaint was that this game didn't have NPC's, which was a huge problem, this has been fixed. Plenty of NPC's in the world, it even has factions with full quest lines now like the BoS. The multiplayer community in this game is shockingly friendly. Someone is far more likely to help you than they are to kill you. In my 80+ hours so far I have yet to see a PKer. It really needs a text global chat, though. The seasons give more motivation to play, some rewards help in game, others are entirely cosmetic, some are unique to that season and can never be earned again. The devs are still updating it today.

My main complaints involve combat and storage. At times, certain enemy types can be a bit janky, if a ghoul dives at you it may visibly teleport a little bit, rarely gun shots won't register immediately, but this has been fixed up a lot and isn't nearly as common anymore. VATS isn't nearly as good in 76, but it's not really an issue that can be fixed. You can't have a VATS that freezes time in a multiplayer game, but because of this Fallout 4's VATS is far better. It has every other function of F4's vats, the crit bar, body part targeting, but no time freeze. My biggest complaint is 1200 weight stash limit. Anyone who has played Bethesda RPG's knows how tempting it is to just hoard everything, good luck doing that with this limit, especially if you are the hoarding type like me. It took me a long time to learn how to work around it.

To summarize: If you like the idea of a multiplayer, co-op Fallout 4 game, then you will definitely enjoy Fallout 76 and it's worth the cheap prices it is today.",i know this game was a disaster at

+ Every class is unique and fun to play with that requires different approaches and playstyles to maximize their potentials.
+ Gun combat is great and I would say even comparable to the likes of gears of war.
+ Gun and armor collecting is always a fun concept that never gets old.
+ Tons of customization options.
+ Crafting is simple and doesn't require much to understand.
+ Enemies and environments has a lot of variety.
+ Cool and huge bosses.
+ Mp is fun especially if you have friends to play with.

- Story is highly generic. Basically the chosen one brought back to save the world and all that crap.
- Pretty standard third person shooter that doesn't really add anything fresh or new to the genre. 
- The Characters in this game are mostly terribly bland and one dimensional. I never even develop any attachment to any of the cast because of how boring they are. Heck don't even care if they all die or survive at the end.
- Pretty Grindy at times and quest are too repetitive.
- You're limited to three skills only which sucks because I love to use a lot of skills depending on the situation.
- Buggy at times like audio desync, enemies getting stuck, enemies randomly freezing, can't pick items, guns wont reload, quest pathing pointing to the wrong direction, areas getting locked because you died, cannot interact with quest. etc...
- Confusing quest system at times like they will give you an acceptable sidequest on an area you can't even access yet.
- Optimizations issues like some areas would drop your fps severely eventhough nothing is happening.

I would have easily given this a thumbs down if I bought this at 70 bucks which how much the game cost here in my country, because it's not really worth the price. But at 20 bucks I have no regrets and did enjoy it for what it is. I also suggest waiting for a sale for people that are still on the fence with this game or better yet try the demo first.

I played all classes, only looping twice with one character, and never again. I play casually, not sweaty, so I've never gone past Mayhem 1-2. If that invalidates my opinion, and this entire review counts as a skill issue, then please; Wipe your greasy hands on the nearest Apex player and go touch tree bark. 

[h1] Guns, Guns, and... Guns? [/h1]
I gotta give it to Gearbox, they know how to make a gun that kills things.
Other than the... oddities...
The gun-play is fine. Nothing really fantastic about it, and nothing really bad about it either.
Really, the only thing I can talk about is the scaling when it comes to damage, and I've never gone past Mayhem 1.
Other than that, the guns really are nothing to talk about; Which is strange, because this game is nothing but guns.

[h1] Fan Fiction... I mean Story [/h1]
Okay that joke is overplayed by a wide margin. But in that joke is a hint of truth, where almost everyone telling the joke, in some weird unity, is saying that the writing is bonkers, even for a Borderlands game (That's impressive).
What can I say that hasn't been said about the story already? Characters are unlikable, direction feels strange, and for some reason, I feel more in connection with Claptrap than Ava.
Again, beating a rotten horse by now, so let me end this section with a Warning to Gearbox:
Randy... If, in the next part of this series, Zer0, at any point of the story, dies or goes missing from the series entirely... I will find you, and strain the grease from your body like a washcloth, and use that grease to fry an entire turkey, where I will stuff the entire turkey back into your body, causing you to start getting greasy. Then, I will put you in a Turkey Grease Loop (tm) until Golden Experience Requiem tells me that enough is enough. (I don't mean any actual harm to Randy, but I'm just saying, don't you dare **** Zer0 up.)
Where was I? Oh yeah...
Story sucks, moving on.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
Grind? What?/10. I can't tell if my luck is worse 'cause I'm not a streamer, or it's just me.
Story? Na/10. Don't mess up Zer0, Randy. I mean it, Randy. With a Buttermilk Breaded Turkey, Randy.
Gameplay? 4/10. How do the guns seem less interesting than the previous games?
Verdict: Screw Epic Games. Get the game when it's on sale. Or, better yet, get the previous games; They're better anyways.",let s start with a disclaimer i played all classes only looping twice with one character and never again i play casually not sweaty so i ve never gone past mayhem one two if that invalidates my opinion and this entire review counts as a skill issue then please wipe your greasy hands on the nearest apex player and go touch tree bark hone guns guns and guns hone i gotta give it to gearbox they know how to make a gun that kills things other than the oddities the gun play is fine nothing really fantastic about it and nothing really bad about it either really the only thing i can talk about is the scaling when it comes to damage and i ve never gone past mayhem one other than that the guns really are nothing to talk about which is strange because this game is nothing but guns hone fan fiction i mean story hone okay that joke is overplayed by a wide margin but in that joke is a hint of truth where almost everyone telling the joke in some weird unity is saying that the writing is bonkers even for a borderlands game that s impressive what can i say that hasn t been said about the story already characters are unlikable direction feels strange and for some reason i feel more in connection with claptrap than ava again beating a rotten horse by now so let me end this section with a warning to gearbox randy if in the next part of this series zer0 at any point of the story dies or goes missing from the series entirely i will find you and strain the grease from your body like a washcloth and use that grease to fry an entire turkey where i will stuff the entire turkey back into your body causing you to start getting greasy then i will put you in a turkey grease loop tm until golden experience requiem tells me that enough is enough i don t mean any actual harm to randy but i m just saying don t you dare zer0 up where was i oh yeah story sucks moving on hone conclusion hone grind what one0 i can t tell if my luck is worse cause i m not a streamer or it s just me story na one0 don t mess up zer0 randy i mean it randy with a buttermilk breaded turkey randy gameplay four one0 how do the guns seem less interesting than the previous games verdict screw epic games get the game when it s on sale or better yet get the previous games they re better anyways,start disclaimer played classes looping character play casually sweaty past mayhem invalidates opinion entire review skill issue wipe greasy hands nearest apex touch tree bark hone guns guns guns hone give gearbox make gun kills things oddities gun play fantastic bad thing talk scaling damage past mayhem guns talk game guns hone fan fiction hone joke overplayed wide margin joke hint truth telling joke weird unity writing bonkers borderlands game impressive characters unlikable direction feels reason feel connection claptrap beating rotten horse end section warning gearbox part series zer0 point dies missing series find grease body washcloth grease entire stuff entire body causing start greasy put grease loop tm experience requiem tells actual harm dare zer0 yeah sucks moving hone conclusion hone grind one0 worse streamer one0 mess zer0 buttermilk breaded gameplay one0 guns interesting previous games verdict screw epic games game previous games,start disclaimer played classes looping character play casually sweaty past mayhem invalidates opinion entire review skill issue wipe greasy hands nearest apex touch tree bark hone guns guns guns hone give gearbox make gun kills things oddities gun play fantastic bad thing talk scaling damage past mayhem guns talk game guns hone fan fiction hone joke overplayed wide margin joke hint truth telling joke weird unity writing bonkers borderlands game impressive characters unlikable direction feels reason feel connection claptrap beating rotten horse end section warning gearbox part series zer0 point dies missing series find grease body washcloth grease entire stuff entire body causing start greasy put grease loop tm experience requiem tells actual harm dare zer0 yeah sucks moving hone conclusion hone grind one0 worse streamer one0 mess zer0 buttermilk breaded gameplay one0 guns interesting previous games verdict screw epic games game previous games,0,2,0.49281314

62154,18,Fri,Mar,2022,09:18:08,Outriders,"Graphics 8/10
Gameplay 10/10
Story 7/10

Biggest issue with this game are the bugs. I have ran into countless bugs that have caused me to restart missions or restart the game (objectives not updating properly on the map, doors/objects not becoming interactive even though all enemies are eliminated, etc). The game also loses connection and occasionally crashes which is very frustrating. Ryzen 7 5800X GTX 1070 16GB 3600Mhz. Specs are not the issue.

I didn't have many issues with the main story but side missions have been a huge headache due to the bugs.

Maybe some glue sniffing developer can clue me in. There is also some weird hesitation in placing objects in build mode.

Game does fine in solo play but whenever you play with friends which is how you get the most out of the game it never wants to work you are consistently crashing or freezing. Played the beta and the game would crash when playing solo. Now i have almost 24 hours in the main game and have had it since release day. Game has a lot of potential but with all the bugs, crashing, and freezing this game becomes almost unplayable. Have done everything i can to ensure it wont crash but nothing has worked.

57296,28,Wed,Oct,2020,10:44:36,Fallout 76,"At first the game was in all capacities a shit show. I had complete disdain for it when I heard about it and was skeptical about it. I was right in my initial reactions but after watching it grow and playing it from time to time it felt like it was getting better. While the multiplayer might put off some still, I believe the story, lore and atmosphere truly make this a real fallout game. The detail of the environment story telling is incredible. Computer entries and notes deliver a lot of exposition and a compelling story too boot. Wastelanders added to this by finally breathing life into the wasteland in the form of NPCs who have their own great stories to tell. Even with the One Wasteland update its still fun to play with friends and explore just now without the fear that you're going to walk into the watoga by accident and get decimated by robots. I will say I'm not a fan of the battle pass or score board as they're calling it in this game. Too many games add this FOMO bait and with all of them vying for your attention to keep you playing its nearly impossible to complete all of them within the same time frame. A good way to fix this if they wanted was to let you play through all the Score boards i.e. you have to finish and play through Armor Aces to get to whatever the new one will be. It would allow people who don't have time to finish get through it without missing rewards while also allow other players to progress and yes even pay to get through levels. It wouldn't hurt playerbase at all and might feel a bit relieving and more inviting to people knowing that can leave and come back and not miss out on anything from the board. Besides that the community is incredible and kind. If you need help or anything most of the time you just have to ask. If anyone is asking about Fallout 1st, its worth it if youre going to use it, if you play this game a lot it IS WORTH it. If you just play every once in a while then obviously no, but don't listen to people who just cry about if they've never purchased it before and/or are not actually using it (playing a lot and often) This game always has me coming back for the aesthetic and just general fun of playing fallout with other people so if you want to give it a shot get it on sale at least and try it.

Bungie decided that we had all had it too easy and decided that it was time to up the overall difficulty of the game, forgetting that not everyone has 16 hours a day to devote to the grind. The big alterations to the Champion feature seemed like it would be an interesting way to help buildcrafting, however all it did was force a *different* build type if you wanted to be able to deal with both Champion types in an activity - which if you are running with randoms - you'll need to, because lord knows no-one else will bring anything that can deal with them.

Then there's the further revised ""always under-level"" gameplay of the power deltas in all of the mid and high level content. I appreciate that some people want an additional challenge, but there are players (including myself) that do not need it, and all it does is lock us out of gameplay. I've made peace with the fact that I don't get to enjoy Raids or Dungeons, but being locked out of the Seasonal activity and Nightfalls is something else. If I hadn't already put too much time into this year's expansion, I'd be looking to refund it.

Unless you have a large friend group that you will always get to play with, just don't bother. Communication is now paramount, and there is no casual play scene.

9/10 would reccommend

Edit: Would absolutely still reccommend the game but as with many games, the biggest negative are the devs themselves. In outriders there are quite a few bugs, anything from immense difficulty signing in, to inventory wipes, to damage mitigation not working causing people to be basically 1 shot. you'd think that these would be the main focus, right? If i ever ran a dev team working on a game with these sorts of issues, i would put all our resources into making it so that people can play the game without issue. seems like common sense right? Well the outriders devs have taken it another route, in favor of making 1 very significant nerf to the main meta of the game, and fixing 1 bug which gave players more damage mitigation than intended with the ""emergency stance"" mod. The major nerf is one thing, when many people cant play the game properly due to issues and they decide to focus on unneccassary balance changes in a PVE game, but the emergency stance fix shines a very important light on a separate issue entirely. After the emergency stance fix, people have been increasingly reporting instances of being 1 shot, or just taking way more damage than they should be. the devs have confirmed that this is a bug that while only revealed after the emergency stance fix, has mostlikely been in the game from day 1. meaning that instead of fixing the current issues, their focus on unnecessary things like the emergency stance fix has not only brought the overall power of players down SIGNIFICANTLY, it has also exacerbated ANOTHER issue that the devs have admitted to not being able to properly recreate.

I'm not sure why Devs can't be more original, but it feels like everytime i think a story is gonna be good it gets dashed at the last second. On top of that the classes are pretty generic, outside of the chorno based class, which can mess with time. Even that might be a little bit generic but not as much as pyro guy and earth guy, at least the engineer is expected, but still pretty generic conceptually. 

But you know what i can forgive all of the above pretty easy if the game itself is fun, and well---it is pretty fun. The gunplay feels good, and while i feel like we need a 4th power slot, as 3 just doesn't feel good to me. The game as a whole plays fairly well WHEN it works. That's probably the biggest issue/flaw i can give it. The game just doesn't work very well, servers are wonky, apparently people are losing there gear after a crash, things just aren't working as they should.

The game feels like it needs to go back in the oven for another 2-3 months--- this is an early access game from what i can tell and not a full release. Until the game is working i can't recommend it, in fact just avoid it till the damn thing is working properly.

Edit: i know i only have 2-3 hours played, BUT i actually cant play this game because of the loot bug, and i have refunded it until, they resolve the issue.

All that aside, it's a lot of fun to play (when things go right) and I've spent a ton of time farming up the right gear and mods, and still looking for guns that aren't in my collection.  

PCF might have rushed this game... but they should have had someone managing the story line. Someone to double check the continuity and put it past a game economist to really balance this thing out. 

So if you enjoy the loot grind, and relatively fun gunplay then this is for you.  If you want the story to make sense probably better to look elsewhere.

I'll list some of its many appealing aspects below.
First, the plot. I enjoyed how quickly and simply the characters were introduced to you. Both your character and your titan had charm, and I think it's fantastic how quickly they developed a bond. It was entertaining to hear and see. And although I understand that the game is mostly centred on the multiplayer component, I thought the campaign was so excellent that I wished it had more to offer.

About the game, No matter if you are on the titan or on the ground, the combat is enjoyable from every angle with the exception of the boss fights, which are somewhat straightforward and don't change much throughout the stages; you primarily fight bosses on their titans, but it is still enjoyable. It is just amazing, just amazing how well done the combat system is, how good the guns are, and how you enjoy every shot.
Overall, regardless of whether it's not on sale, this game is worthwhile.

Again, one of those games with a lot of good content that is entirely ruined by some very poor decision making and / or wilfull ignorance of different types of players out there in the world.
This feels like a game made by and for console players, with PC players coming in a very poor second, again.
Once again, this game is an example of Developers thinking they know better than the players how they want or should play a game, control wise.
The lack of any real ability for the PC player to manually change some janky embedded controls for cr*p like emotes is what ruins this otherwise potentially good game.

Not every gamer in the world uses a console .. and not every gamer in the world is right handed and / or uses WASD to move.

But, as I say, once again we are exposed to the deliberate narrow minded thinking and development of a game that could have been good.

*** Edit Update

This game is utterly boring and tedious and has zero appeal beyond a superficial interesting look about it.

Borderlands was a fairly good idea when it was Borderlands 1 and even 2 .. but, it ran out of ideas then and Borderlands 3 brings nothing else to the game concept or franchise.

They even still use the antiquated and regressive stale idea of 'paying' for one's respawn.

As soon as it was for sale, with 67% off, after reading better reviews of it and being a fan of the series, I decided to buy it. 

And it's absolutely great! Mainly for avid Fallout series players. I've played the entire collection so far, and the forth game along with the New Vegas title, are the best ones in my opinion. Fallout 76 is a lot like Fallout 4, which honestly, I think is a very good thing, giving that I really liked the previous title. There are some new features like the ""card perk system"" that I actually liked it, besides that, nothing too different. 

I wasn't playing it when the game was released, so I can't tell how bad it actually was. But one thing I can say for sure, Bethesda's staff has been constantly updating the game in order to fix the bugs and issues. Currently, I can say for sure that the game is highly addictive and fun to play.

Is the game perfect? With no bugs? No server issues? Well, no. There are some bugs here and there, server starts not responding randomly for about 2 or 3 seconds, a relatively updated PC machine is required in order to run the game properly with good FPS (which is funny, giving that the graphics didn't improve much from Fallout 4 to Fallout 76), the menu system is confusing and takes a little getting used to it. Quest sharing with your friends is not present in-game. 

But you know what? None of these problems prevented me from, not only playing, but also inviting some skeptic friends to play it. We've all enjoyed the experience so far, coping with these issues mentioned above, but having fun. The most important part is that clearly Bethesda has been working hard to improve the game and player's experience. This gives me hope that the game will have always improvements and much to offer.",probably like you reader of comments that is not sure whether to buy this game or not after so much criticism two stars ratings on the xbox game pass and a lot of hate comments i didn t buy this game at first as soon as it was for sale with sixty seven percent off after reading better reviews of it and being a fan of the series i decided to buy it and it s absolutely great mainly for avid fallout series players i ve played the entire collection so far and the forth game along with the new vegas title are the best ones in my opinion fallout seventy six is a lot like fallout four which honestly i think is a very good thing giving that i really liked the previous title there are some new features like the card perk system that i actually liked it besides that nothing too different i wasn t playing it when the game was released so i can t tell how bad it actually was but one thing i can say for sure bethesda s staff has been constantly updating the game in order to fix the bugs and issues currently i can say for sure that the game is highly addictive and fun to play is the game perfect with no bugs no server issues well no there are some bugs here and there server starts not responding randomly for about two or three seconds a relatively updated pc machine is required in order to run the game properly with good fps which is funny giving that the graphics didn t improve much from fallout four to fallout seventy six the menu system is confusing and takes a little getting used to it quest sharing with your friends is not present in game but you know what none of these problems prevented me from not only playing but also inviting some skeptic friends to play it we ve all enjoyed the experience so far coping with these issues mentioned above but having fun the most important part is that clearly bethesda has been working hard to improve the game and player s experience this gives me hope that the game will have always improvements and much to offer,comments buy game criticism stars ratings xbox game lot hate comments buy game percent reading reviews fan series decided buy absolutely great avid fallout series players played entire collection game title opinion fallout lot fallout honestly thing giving previous title features perk system playing game released bad thing bethesda staff constantly updating game order bugs issues game highly addictive fun play game perfect bugs server issues bugs server starts responding randomly seconds updated pc machine required order run game properly fps funny giving graphics improve fallout fallout menu system confusing takes quest sharing friends present game problems prevented playing inviting skeptic friends play enjoyed experience coping issues mentioned fun important part bethesda working hard improve game experience game improvements offer,comments buy game criticism stars ratings xbox game lot hate comments buy game percent reading reviews fan series decided buy absolutely great avid fallout series players played entire collection game title opinion fallout lot fallout honestly thing giving previous title features perk system playing game released bad thing bethesda staff constantly updating game order bugs issues game highly addictive fun play game perfect bugs server issues bugs server starts responding randomly seconds updated pc machine required order run game properly fps funny giving graphics improve fallout fallout menu system confusing takes quest sharing friends present game problems prevented playing inviting skeptic friends play enjoyed experience coping issues mentioned fun important part bethesda working hard improve game experience game improvements offer,1,0,0.0

On a more serious note, it's really good.

The world is vast. It keeps surprising you around every turn, and it feels far from empty. If you're taking your time, there's always something to see or fight or farm for. The world is absolutely stunning and I felt compelled to explore every corner of it because it deserves all of the time you put into it. 

If you like Souls games, you'll probably really enjoy this, even though it really diverts from the classic linear dungeons for much of the game. If you've never played a Souls game before, this is a pretty decent place to start. It's much more approachable with its combat, and I'd call it the easiest in the series due to summoning and a few other features (which you can play without if you prefer the challenge).

My one issue with the game is that it feels quite unbalanced. Since you're able to progress in various ways, if you play this like your standard open-world game you'll quickly find yourself over-leveled for many of the fights. It was certainly something I noticed since I stop to fight everything I come across in these types of games. Some dungeons will feel like a walk in the park, and then you go to a new location and get whooped. If you take your time in a single place long enough, you'll really feel it getting easier.

The bosses are pretty fun, also everyone overhyped Malenia to no end. She's really not that hard. Don't let it get to you.

93878,2,Mon,May,2022,01:31:14,Titanfall 2," 10/10. WOO THIS GAME IS FIXED. This game is (except for 2 weapons) balanced. This is a very unique take on the fps genre and a very unique take on your wallet. This game is a pretty good deal that often goes on sale.Due to ddosing, you will have to do simple modding to fix it (Northstar for titanfall 2) and add new stuff. The 2 hour campaign secretly teaches you how to be an intelligent player and matches  a 20 hour one. It has a huge scale and a nice touch of boom. The gameplay is like this for both the campaign and the multiplayer: run on walls, slide around, and chain hops as a human (called a pilot) wearing a jump-kit allowing for this while shooting enemies or using heavy weapons to destroy titans. Titans are giant 40 ton robots with a very good variety of different classes, perks that do not disappoint, and weaknesses forcing coordination you often make without communication, but paying attention to your fellow titans and pilots (you only have friendly pilots in multiplayer). (Multiplayer only) A pilot can summon their own titan once they earn enough points (doing damage to Titans and defeating enemies). Then, that pilot can jump into the titan class they chose to spawn. You can take out the batteries from enemy titans, which gives you score, and put it in anybody on your team's(including your titan) titan for points. This harms the enemy titan and gives shields, core energy, and and hp to the receiver. Core energy can also be achieved defeating and harming enemies. When you have 100% core energy, you basically unlock a final smash. If your titan loses all of it's health, it goes into doomed state. If your doomed hp bar hits zero, you and your titan die. If an enemy titan melees you and you are doomed, they do a sick finisher animation that one shots you. The pilots also have customization. The huge SMGs are truly a beauty of sub-machinery. Use these if you want a feel for the game, but there are other weapons, some are memes, some have bigger learning curves, and others.... exist. Speed is one of the most important skills to have as a pilot, trust me.

The story line is very linear and predicable, though it was interesting enough to keep me engaged. The characters are fun and unique. Once you find the class you enjoy the game does get a bit better.  Overall it is your typical FPS gear grinding type game, similar to Destiny.  I have not played the DLC at this time, but a new needed expansion released within the last week.  

Once you clear the main story, the game turns into a gear grind game.  I hate anything with this specific grind, but this game kept my interest for an additional 10-15 hours.  I believe it was because the process didn't feel as grindy as you see in other games, and the loot system works a bit different.

If you can find the game on sale I would grab it, especially if you have a couple friends to run through it with.

68240,4,Tue,May,2021,05:17:41,Outriders,"There's a very solid game here, and the core gameplay is fun. The story isn't great, but it's surprisingly good for a looter shooter. I would actually rate it much higher than Destiny 2 (but let's not get into that). While the ending was a bit disappointing, I still found myself compelled to finish it.

The reason I'm downvoting this game is because the devs have, thus far, severely mishandled the post-launch with patches that have (supposedly) nerfed the top builds, all while reducing the amount of time available to get the best loot. Yes, that's right: the endgame activities are time-gated, and now you have less time to complete it, with worse builds.

Even worse than all that is that the devs have no concrete plans (that we know) to release any sort of DLC or expansion. In other words, no matter how good this game is, the endgame is disappointing, and it sounds like this may well be as good as it'll ever get. Despite all this, this game is always-online, and has zero PVP. It's mostly playable solo (aside from the top-tier endgame, but that's also debatable), and features zero communication features (text/voice). It has all the trappings and downsides of a live service game... but without any of the benefits. 

I simply can't recommend this game, despite having enjoyed my time with it, because you will invariably end up disappointed in this game.

74607,11,Sun,Apr,2021,10:28:06,Outriders,"Do Not purchase this game...

Please save yourself the time and money and DO NOT purchase it. Here my breakdown

Normally i wait for 3-4 weeks before i purchase basically any game, to which i can then read reviews and see how the game has left players feeling. I got suckered into this one and bought it on day 2 due to friends asking me to and wanting to play together. I should have waited...

1. Story - (No Spoilers dont worry) - Eh, its not bad..i actually enjoyed how they set up the powers part of it and how the overall idea of the shooter/power looter. The voice acting is actually really good but there are still some audio voiceline mis-syncs that go on...which they had in the demo and stated they would fix...they didnt.  The NPCs that follow you and basically are part of the crew do actually have some personality unlike some other recent games that have basically really easily forgettable characters. The story is good overall but nothing thatll put you on the edge of your seat..some parts couldve been better while others were just right. 

2. Combat - Pretty solid actually, pretty much got a good feel of every gun class and they all have their own different feel and sounds. it was fun getting to blow thru some enemies early on while trying to figure out which class of gun you liked. The powers feel pretty strong at times when you synergize them well. Some powers will feel really good while others seem to have maybe a little lack-luster feel or effect. After a while though once you hone in on what class you like and seem to have things rolling, youll get to the ridiculous bullet spongey mess that it is. Now dont get me wrong, i understand that if looter shooters didnt have bullet sponge effects..then youd mow thru everything and it wouldnt matter what loot you had..i get it..but my point is that i wish some Devs would take the idea to make the enemies more fun to shoot so that we didnt realize so easily that its just blasting 1000 rounds into this guys face..until he eventually dies...make it fun.. make the enemies arms blow off..armor falls apart when its shot to shit..make it fun ..pretty much the only thing they did along those lines is make head pop when you headshot em..but if you focus on that all the time..youll get swarmed. So the combat is good, but becomes kinda mundane after a few hours..its basically go here, shoot some guys, kill the mini boss or boss, move on to a new area and do it again until you reach the end. 

3. Loot - OMG, one of the worst parts of the game imo. Looter/shooter..right...youd think the loot is good though or should be close because thats what its all about..the loot...Well...sorry to tell you.. it sucks. So like most looter games, in the beginning..its all cool getting new items and goin over the stats and skill and abilities...blah blah..but of course comes the part where you figure out what you want and what things you need. ugh, where to start. first off i guess...theres 3 main components on armor (Firepower, Anomaly power, Max Health) that roll. Basically doesnt matter much in the beginning but after a few hours of gameplay youll know what your class needs. My friend and I would constantly get gear with the main stat of which we didnt use..which is eh..its RNG baby..but youll realize that you cant re-roll that stat to the other..so when youre waiting to get some high end gear ..and you finally do..and it rolls one of the others..its trash basically.. and this will happen time and time again..to the point that its frustrating as hell because you may not be able to move forward without that piece. Then theres the abilities that roll with the gear, some are effects while others boost your skills. and its the same thing as before..however, you can re-roll your abilities..but only one and after you re-roll it...that becomes the only slot that you can re-roll...you can do it as many times as you like, but again..once you get high end that finally rolls ur main stat...you better hope that one of the abilities is the one you need, because if both arent what you need..its trash. Then theres the guns..not much here, they also roll abilities..same effect..you can only re-roll one and then its locked. but there sniper rifles with a bonus to close range damage (cant re-roll that stat but you can increase it) SMGs with long range dam boost..sometimes your weapon will roll the same ability twice, example: ive gotten several weapons where both abilities inflict bleed or ash effect..which again..you can change one of em..but you shouldnt get that anyway..Basically the loot system needs an entire over-haul.

4. Trading - there is none...no...none..sorry...So if youre playing with friends and one of them uses LMGs and you dont and you just got a really really good one that they could use....well equip it i guess and let em see it..then break it down because too bad...This game really needs trading to some extent (all loot based games do). Maybe something like Diablo 3...you know, if ur playing with friends and an item drops for you..but u dont need it or use it..you can trade it only to the people that were in ur group when it dropped..yeah no..ok

5. Bugs - Holy SHiiiii friends buckle up...i wont go too far into em

- Server issues -  Jesus H...you know the rest.. well idk how some of these studios measure things,,but i swear these guys must not know how to count. Day 1 and even now still constant crashes....game will crash while playing solo...and even wayyy more so when playing with friends. the only way i could re-connect with friends after a crash is by completely closing down and re-starting steam... and even then it would sometimes still not connect or crash very shortly after re-joining. the ""they must not know how to count"" comment pertained to them having the same issue with the demo. If 300k people login and play the demo...youd think they would AT LEAST prep the servers to handle 300k..but instead it seems like they lowered the bandwidth...idk but yeah..still having crashes all over the place.

 - Players Disappearing - Yup pretty self explanatory, some players will have the glitch of there charcter just suddenly disappear upon using a skill..problem is you cant do anything when it happens except ctrl-alt-del and force close the game.

 - Enemies falling thru map - another self explanatory one. Mostly happens during the end-game expeditions..but an enemy or enemies will randomly fall thru the map which causes you to ultimately fail the exp since you have to kill all the enemies.

 - Inventory wipe -  So they released a patch a day ago and that introduced the inventory wipe glitch. they had this problem with the demo so...welcome back! Lately players would log in and attempt to join a party to quickly have yet another crash sequence..and once they came back..theyd find a naked character and completely empty inventory...yeah...ouch..hurt feelings..the devs have stated that they are goin to check logs and whatnot to get the players their stuff back..but we're talking thousands of people..so yeah, doubt this will happen for them all..also..how long of a wait are they talking here...i mean, they still havenet fixed the servers yet...

 - They are already nerfing builds and items...yeah..or as they put it ""balancing""...basically they said that they were questioning why some build were being played more than others ( the builds being played were more efficient and worked well when built correctly) but instead of buffing or making the unpopular builds viable...they just nerf the ones that were working well...you know..cause logic. Why are they nerfing or balancing anything in the game right now instead of working on making the servers stable and fixing actual bugs and glitches is beyond me. 

So the constant crashing and horrible loot system and coupled with the complete lack of trading and lack of end-game content..i cant recommend this game right now.
",do not purchase this game please save yourself the time and money and do not purchase it here my breakdown normally i wait for three four weeks before i purchase basically any game to which i can then read reviews and see how the game has left players feeling i got suckered into this one and bought it on day two due to friends asking me to and wanting to play together i should have waited one story no spoilers dont worry eh its not bad i actually enjoyed how they set up the powers part of it and how the overall idea of the shooter power looter the voice acting is actually really good but there are still some audio voiceline mis syncs that go on which they had in the demo and stated they would fix they didnt the npcs that follow you and basically are part of the crew do actually have some personality unlike some other recent games that have basically really easily forgettable characters the story is good overall but nothing thatll put you on the edge of your seat some parts couldve been better while others were just right two combat pretty solid actually pretty much got a good feel of every gun class and they all have their own different feel and sounds it was fun getting to blow thru some enemies early on while trying to figure out which class of gun you liked the powers feel pretty strong at times when you synergize them well some powers will feel really good while others seem to have maybe a little lack luster feel or effect after a while though once you hone in on what class you like and seem to have things rolling youll get to the ridiculous bullet spongey mess that it is now dont get me wrong i understand that if looter shooters didnt have bullet sponge effects then youd mow thru everything and it wouldnt matter what loot you had i get it but my point is that i wish some devs would take the idea to make the enemies more fun to shoot so that we didnt realize so easily that its just blasting one000 rounds into this guys face until he eventually dies make it fun make the enemies arms blow off armor falls apart when its shot to shit make it fun pretty much the only thing they did along those lines is make head pop when you headshot em but if you focus on that all the time youll get swarmed so the combat is good but becomes kinda mundane after a few hours its basically go here shoot some guys kill the mini boss or boss move on to a new area and do it again until you reach the end three loot omg one of the worst parts of the game imo looter shooter right youd think the loot is good though or should be close because thats what its all about the loot well sorry to tell you it sucks so like most looter games in the beginning its all cool getting new items and goin over the stats and skill and abilities blah blah but of course comes the part where you figure out what you want and what things you need ugh where to start first off i guess theres three main components on armor firepower anomaly power max health that roll basically doesnt matter much in the beginning but after a few hours of gameplay youll know what your class needs my friend and i would constantly get gear with the main stat of which we didnt use which is eh its rng baby but youll realize that you cant re roll that stat to the other so when youre waiting to get some high end gear and you finally do and it rolls one of the others its trash basically and this will happen time and time again to the point that its frustrating as hell because you may not be able to move forward without that piece then theres the abilities that roll with the gear some are effects while others boost your skills and its the same thing as before however you can re roll your abilities but only one and after you re roll it that becomes the only slot that you can re roll you can do it as many times as you like but again once you get high end that finally rolls ur main stat you better hope that one of the abilities is the one you need because if both arent what you need its trash then theres the guns not much here they also roll abilities same effect you can only re roll one and then its locked but there sniper rifles with a bonus to close range damage cant re roll that stat but you can increase it smgs with long range dam boost sometimes your weapon will roll the same ability twice example ive gotten several weapons where both abilities inflict bleed or ash effect which again you can change one of em but you shouldnt get that anyway basically the loot system needs an entire over haul four trading there is none no none sorry so if youre playing with friends and one of them uses lmgs and you dont and you just got a really really good one that they could use well equip it i guess and let em see it then break it down because too bad this game really needs trading to some extent all loot based games do maybe something like diablo three you know if ur playing with friends and an item drops for you but u dont need it or use it you can trade it only to the people that were in ur group when it dropped yeah no ok five bugs holy shiiiii friends buckle up i wont go too far into em server issues jesus h you know the rest well idk how some of these studios measure things but i swear these guys must not know how to count day one and even now still constant crashes game will crash while playing solo and even wayyy more so when playing with friends the only way i could re connect with friends after a crash is by completely closing down and re starting steam and even then it would sometimes still not connect or crash very shortly after re joining the they must not know how to count comment pertained to them having the same issue with the demo if three00k people login and play the demo youd think they would at least prep the servers to handle three00k but instead it seems like they lowered the bandwidth idk but yeah still having crashes all over the place players disappearing yup pretty self explanatory some players will have the glitch of there charcter just suddenly disappear upon using a skill problem is you cant do anything when it happens except ctrl alt del and force close the game enemies falling thru map another self explanatory one mostly happens during the end game expeditions but an enemy or enemies will randomly fall thru the map which causes you to ultimately fail the exp since you have to kill all the enemies inventory wipe so they released a patch a day ago and that introduced the inventory wipe glitch they had this problem with the demo so welcome back lately players would log in

Pros
+ Decent graphics, worlds look nice
+ Okay story
+ Pretty good variety of armour, weapons, mods

Cons
- Lots of bugs, fortunately (at least for me so far), none have been game breaking
- Visual/audio glitches
- Too many repetitive cutscenes, level layouts
- Game balance: okay in story mode, non-existant in endgame (unless happen to have perfect gear/mods)
- Coop is terrible: lag, very few viable builds (see point above, unless you're high DPS get kicked more often than not)
- Replayability: if you want to try different classes, have to go through the whole story for each character (maybe this wouldn't be so bad if each class had a somewhat different approach with some variety in sidequests or something)
- Endgame: boring and repetitive, right now DPS due to timers is only option, could've easily had:
* variety of missions/objectives instead of one
* incentives to play coop with variety of classes
* more customization options (e.g., ability to switch out all mods, legendary having 3 mods etc.)
- Nerfs: weird decisions by developer to nerf builds, sometimes without fully notifying players of exact changes, given it's a non-competitive PVE game, makes no sense, especially given the OP enemies and AI

With so much of the content going in the direction of FOMO and pointless, tiring grind, I just can't do it anymore.

40866,15,Wed,Mar,2023,14:34:27,Fallout 76,"After 300 hours and being leveling up to level 356 let me tell you real quick the game is not worth your time or money, even if it was free play it will still bad a sad excuse for a MMO or whatever you wanna label it. The caps in game money is capped for some reason at 40k so you can't just keep adding caps you have too spend them before you reach the cap other wise those caps go too waste. Their are no modern features in this game such as cross play or cross save. if you buy a skin on psn, xbox, or pc you have too buy it again. If your like me and have a good pc or a monitor with 300hz You have dumb down your Fps inorder for your game to be even pop up other wise you get a black screen of nothing-ness. The Fps is garbage and laughable I don't even get 60 fps in events or when I travel to major locations. Also RNG in this game is just the worst go play borderlands if you want a good looter shooter even Bl3 has better story then this mess of a RPG. theres also two factions in the game raiders and settlers you can pick a side when it comes too the story wont spoil that but what I will spoil is that you can max our both of their rep making them both love you..... WTF is the point of picking one or the other it should lock you out of join or being around either or makes no sense. Also the game is becoming pay for advantage even more with fallout 1st, you get the unlimited ammo box too store  your missiles and nukes that weigh an ungodly amount even for just 30 of them weigh like 20 to 30 lbs of gear or inventory slots, the unlimited scrap box which its self explained, and now with the new update you get bonus loot boxes for being a fallout 1st member. At what point do they just say fk it pay to win, I high recommend you play legit anything even fking league of legends. Also bonus nitpick there is no end game content, no dungeon raids, limited side quest compared too every other fallout game, and the story you can knock out in less than 10 hours or 20 if you take your time. after the main quest are done you legit have nothing too do, no fishing, no hunting, nothing anything remotely fun. Also keep in mind the last story mission was added 2 years ago. and the last sin of this abomination of a fallout game the auto axe one of best melee weapons in the game cost 1k stamps okay cool just gotta run pit missions, oh I can only do 1 a day or every 6 to 8 hours. So I did the math 1k divided by 10 is 100 days. you would have too wait 3 months and a week for one weapon and thats if your lucky and get 10 sometimes even when you get all 3 side objectives the game says YEET and only give you 7-8 stamps. Yes you can sever hop which I really hate doing BTW inorder too get a better chainsaw weapon and then you need another 250 stamps for your weapon mod so thats over 4 to 5 months of grinding for one 1 weapon and 1 mod if you chose not to sever hop. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME PLAY ANYTHING ELSE Hell even Bf2042 is a better game.",after three hundred hours and being leveling up to level three hundred and fifty six let me tell you real quick the game is not worth your time or money even if it was free play it will still bad a sad excuse for a mmo or whatever you wanna label it the caps in game money is capped for some reason at four0k so you can t just keep adding caps you have too spend them before you reach the cap other wise those caps go too waste their are no modern features in this game such as cross play or cross save if you buy a skin on psn xbox or pc you have too buy it again if your like me and have a good pc or a monitor with three hundredhz you have dumb down your fps inorder for your game to be even pop up other wise you get a black screen of nothing ness the fps is garbage and laughable i don t even get sixty fps in events or when i travel to major locations also rng in this game is just the worst go play borderlands if you want a good looter shooter even blthree has better story then this mess of a rpg theres also two factions in the game raiders and settlers you can pick a side when it comes too the story wont spoil that but what i will spoil is that you can max our both of their rep making them both love you wtf is the point of picking one or the other it should lock you out of join or being around either or makes no sense also the game is becoming pay for advantage even more with fallout onest you get the unlimited ammo box too store your missiles and nukes that weigh an ungodly amount even for just thirty of them weigh like twenty to thirty lbs of gear or inventory slots the unlimited scrap box which its self explained and now with the new update you get bonus loot boxes for being a fallout

68263,4,Tue,May,2021,02:58:47,Outriders,"My very first negative review in all my years with Steam. Painful game. Truly painful. No crash for me. But experienced one quest bug where NPC failed to appear. Performance is solid. Gameplay...horrible. Here's what you do: Get a mission, clear a path meaning kill bad guys, move cart/destroy obstacle/clear rocks/clear fallen trees to get to next stage or path to the next mission stage- repeat three times this pattern then kill boss. 

You can tell if you are about to get into a firefight. You'll see obvious positioning of stones, defense barriers, fallen trees, or wooden fences, strategically positioned on the map. Maps are tiny, connected by loading screens. that take you from one firefight to the next. Then you see are blocked by a some obstacle and with the press of the default ""E"" key, you enter into the same cutscene of your hero moving stuff out of the way. Early on, you will know the three most useful skills you will be using in the game- .in the entire game. The rest of the skills are just *yawn"". Skill tree is insulting and quite simple, meaning it's just simple. There's no room for experimentation. 

Absolutely no variety on the gameplay. Just keep plowing through baddies for the next hour or until your brain goes numb. Now... I understand this is a loot fest type game but people... the amount of garbage you pick up, then dismantle, then craft is just well... under whelming.  The action is clearly a repetitive cover, shoot, cover shoot, made ""complex"" by skills that really are just *yawn*..starting to fall asleep here. I think it is safe to say that shooter grindfest made like ARPG loot fest just will not cut it. There's something missing here. Purchase at your own risk.

but the big thing is of course the completly f**** up mechanics after the highly awaited patches. I have never been so disapointed with a way of ""fixing"" a game really! 

I am ok with giving some time if a game is not perfect from the get go... even if you would expect it considering the price, the rolled out demo (!) and the publishing studio. But the way you guys just cluster f**** this up is laughable to say the least. 

I am surprised (with myself?) with the patience players do have for this game. So there HAS to be something deep down to the core, something this game does very right. But honestly if hundreds of players would go on and sue the publisher it wouldnt surprise me at all. I would probably be joining myself.

Dear publishers... your time of stretching out and fans patience is pretty much over. You may enjoy the money genereated but it WILL come at a much more higher cost and you will have to pay some day this is for sure.

The different classes all feel very different and fun. I never found myself really hating the combat, You will find yourself rarely hiding behind cover unless you go the sniper route.

End game reminds me of the rift system from Diablo 3. Very fun and the maps rotate, Pushing to do your best time and trying to get the best in slot loot keeps you pushing through the different tiers.

Now, is this a good game? Yes 100% it feels amazing to play and it is fun.
However, the story and pretty much the entire base campaign is absolute crap, i would not recommend at all.

my advice, get a save file online, as low as you want with no gear or upgrades, completely blank BUT, has done the main campaign. its not worth it, the side missions are alot better, get the DLCs as they are fantastic (Kriegs was disappointing but still better then anything in the main story).

The season 2 pass may be a bit controversial however if you enjoy the first pass go for it, Arms race is great if not a little empty and the extra stuff on top is enjoyable.

Last thing, if there is a mod out there, i have not found one yet, remove a character called Ava. worst character i have ever seen and is like 20% of the issue with the main campaign.

Also, that Pitt content that got announced ages ago? Turns out it's crap too. I played one of the missions and was faced with bullet sponge after bullet sponge. I eventually just stopped trying to move around during a fight and just stood there soaking up damage, because I had the stimpaks to survive it all. For reference, I did not do a lot of grinding in this game. Then the final boss literally stood in an open room and fired maybe six shots at me, spending the rest of the time just standing there, staring off into space as I dumped a nonstop stream of bullets into them for four minutes straight. Also, the writing is some prime edgelord garbage. When asked what he's going to do after the mission is over, a character seriously says ""Don't ask a shadow where it's going.

This game was fun with friends for the free trial & later on as well I got this manure on sale because I did enjoy it for some time 

But eventually it became a horrid shore not fun especially solo everything is your level or higher (Always need power armor to survive until access to maybe secret service gear or brotherhood recon gear RNG Daily Ops) Inventory management is utterly abysmal (because of the scrap which is quite important) 

This ""game"" is riddled with many bugs/glitches like weapons disappearing, clipping through walls, enemies sniping through walls & constant laggy broken servers (""Worlds"")

If the basic features from F 1'st (Scrapbox at least) would be in this game for free maybe I would recommend this on hefty sales but because they are not I won't ever recommend this

Heard a lot of bad stuff about it and was therefore somewhat averse to play this game (even though I bought it on sale for 8.99â¬). The world seemed empty to me in the beginning with not enought ""life"" in it to be enjoyable, but after I started my second character and fixed my graphic settings I found the ""fun"" in this game and really enjoy it since.

First of all the map, the landscapes and locations are all beautiful. I love all the little details and visual story telling in this game. I look at every oh so small detail at each of the locations because they are just filled with small stories that are not obvioudly told to you but rather have to be discovered (via notes, holotapes or especially placement of small things like items or skeletons a.s.o.) by the player. I'm a huge fan of exploring Fallout maps and already discovered many many details in the previous 3d-Fallout games, so I'm happy that this region had been given just as much love to detail as the previous parts. I was also very pleased with the overall gameplay (which is pretty much the same as Fallout 4's survival mode), the ""newly"" added human NPCs and questlines to discover. Even as someone that only plays ""singleplayer style"" without joining public teams I've found my fun with this game.

59395,7,Tue,Jul,2020,11:57:38,Fallout 76,"I was one of the long term fans of Fallout 3/NV/4 who initially passed on 76, mostly because of the inexplicable omission of human NPCs. With the Wastelanders expansion, they have finally filled this gaping hole and after playing through the first 33 hours I have to say I'm glad I waited because I can't even imagine how dull this game would have been without them. 

But, if you're thinking of buying Fallout 76, this isn't your main concern, is it? You want to know how multiplayer works and how much it interfers with your gameplay experience. Well, to me the biggest concern so far has not been other players. Maybe I've been lucky, but so far I've only occasionally bumped into other people and apart from a couple of ""wave"" emotes and a nuke dropping at the other end of the map every now and then, they have not been a concern at all. The most jarring thing is the latency every now and then when looting and when sniping targets far away. Playing as a lone wolf this is rarely a gamebreaker but it's there as a constant reminder that this is a watered down Fallout experience. 

Hunger and thirst is mandatory, but food and drink is easy to come by so these are fairly easy to manage. However, storage is limited to a single global ""stash"" container available at your camp as well as some strategic locations in the game world. As someone who usually squirrels away every single type of weapon, armor, clothing, ammo and crafting material, this further forces me to play the game a little different than I did the previous installments. It also means that your capacity to carry things becomes more important, and since skills, perks and attributes are completely different from what we're used to, managing encumbrance is also more difficult. All of this forces you to make hard choices what to keep, what to trade and what to simply leave behind. Ofcourse, this was always the case, but I find it more of a nuisance this time around.

TL;DR: Sacrifices have been made to turn Fallout into an MMO. Sort of works. Get it on sale.

EDIT: After the ""One Wasteland"" update which introduced ""level scaling"", each time you gain a level, so does everything around you. If your build isn't ""perfectly optimized"" (a.k.a you're roleplaying for the story) then the odds will just keep stacking against you. Can no longer recommend.

Since then I've discovered Steam and played many other games, some of which I enjoyed, but nothing...NOTHING touches the richness of experience that Fallout provides. So now I'm late to trying out 76, but so far, I like it. The world is immersive and gorgeous. I don't really like the perk card system. I've watched several videos about how it works, but I still don't get it, so basically I'm just throwing cards wherever. I also don't like the workshop situation. I claim a workshop, start to build, but then when I'm off, someone else can claim it from me?  I spent until level 10 gathering supplies and then built lots of work benches, all I'd need, at my first workshop site, but when I logged back in, it all was gone.  Not much incentive to build, which is a bit of a pity for me because I LOVED the building aspect of FO4.  But, I'm still trying to get the hang of it all and I just love being in the world.  Oh, I hate the scorchers and I do wish I wouldn't get ganged up on by mutants or scorchers or anything else when I can't even be at a level where I can use power armor.

77920,8,Thu,Apr,2021,02:23:12,Outriders,"This is not a 60 dollar game. I would say 30 - 40 is a reasonable price so hold out till then for the purchase.

After trying the demo I really thought this game would be exciting. I Thought the classes would have some interesting dynamics to them and was looking forward to playing through the story. Unfortunately the game falls flat pretty quickly after the first couple of story line progression points passed the demo.

Cons:
- The game is not conducive to solo play. Some people might argue saying you have to spec a certain way to play but if that's the argument then it proves my point as to why it's not conducive to solo play. One shouldn't have to be forced a certain way to play through in single player just to enjoy the game since that certain spec may not be enjoyable to the 
player.
- The cover system is for enemies, not the player. It's a bit ridiculous that they even put in a mod that increases damage while in cover when this game doesn't allow you to take advantage of that.
- All the class skill points are the same per class. They just have different names for each tier. Top/mid/bottom trees are all the same across each class more or less and don't add anything which makes each class more dynamic. 
- The wold is very linear and map/travel system is just janky. Why they tried to recreate the wheel here is beyond me.
-Fast traveling requires you to go to a camp first if you want to travel to a town to turn in a quest. SO you basically have to fast travel twice. Once to camp, then from camp to town. In a game with a ton of cut scenes already I guess this goes with the ""flow"".
- Boring story which leads to lack of interest in reading the journals on the world/characters. The new journal notification just becomes a nuisance on the screen after a while.
- A drill mechanic to mine ore/resources.... Why??? Why is this in the game? Not needed at all and just breaks up the momentum. You're running fast to go kill some more shit but wait... I see some ore, better stop and pull out this drill from my back to fill the void of a survival niche some gamer might desire. Just a dumb mechanic and the resources could have just been included in the drops from enemy kills or chests.
- The game wants you to sight in (ADS) but at the same time when doing so you can't see hazards on the ground and around you due to the zoom in. It forces you to zoom in and out a lot which feels counter intuitive during fights.
- Annoying cut scenes all over the place. 
- All the mobs look the same except they change colors from time to time
- movement is kind of stiff but the game wants you to move a lot. Again, it's counter intuitive.

Pros:
- Some of the abilities the classes have are fun to execute. 
- Group play is pretty entertaining. This game was meant for co-op and if you have a group that is dedicated to playing it then it may just be for you.
- Pretty world/graphics",this is not a sixty dollar game i would say thirty forty is a reasonable price so hold out till then for the purchase after trying the demo i really thought this game would be

The old updates to end-game don't matter, because nobody wants to get to end-game since the main game is in such an awful state - meaning the whole co-op aspect is utterly dead.

Original review follows:

-----------------------------------------------


The more I play this game, the more it falls apart.  There are rampant bugs and oversights that permeate the experience at every level.  Due to the character limit on Steam reviews, I'm going to do my best to just detail as many as I can.

VFX:

OUTRIDERS has a ton of problems here.  FMV cinematics feature highly visible tearing and frame rate drop on larger/4K/144hz displays (including the unskippable, obnoxiously loud cutscene that plays every time the game launches).  In-engine cinematics suffer from texture popping, and textures being occluded/wiped out by in-game weather effects.  

There are also tons of continuity errors between cinematics and in-engine videos, and even between moments in the same scene on in-game cinematics.

SFX:

An even bigger mess.  SFX volume is uneven across the board.  I have to keep them turned down because weapon SFX are so loud, with some guns screaming over their already overly-loud peers, but this completely washes out most environmental sounds.

Voices are particularly bad.  Yells whisper, whispers scream at you from across the map like they're in your head, voices run over the top of each other, or form a queue that cascades at you all in a rush.

Mechanics:

Auto-loot has been broken since April, there is a better area loot system in place, neither are necessary - just pop up the icon for loot and deposit the item in my inventory.

Quest markers float around your mini-map uselessly until you're within ~100 feet of objectives, the active tracking system frequently points to your most recently completed quest, not the one you currently have selected.

There is an obnoxious blood-splatter filter that obscures your screen and hud when taking damage in combat.

Enemy AI is terrible, either charging you all in a rush, or seemingly losing track of you completely.  To compensate, maps are broken in to tiny segments, and the game has an absurd system that fully resets your encounter if you spend more than 10 seconds dropping out of the prescribed combat zone - even if it's because an enemy knocked you back/prone in to that area.

Story:

The main plot is decent, but sidequests go off the rails completely, starting with ""The Alchemist.""  There are gross continuity errors, terrible voice acting, beyond stupid plot points and setups.  It's so bad, it's actively insulting.  One quest began with discovering a murdered/hanged fellow-Outrider who was decent enough to leave a letter at the feet of his own corpse, detailing his deepest secrets and initiating the quest.

As a final aside, the state of this game really saddens me.  There are very likeable things, things a lot of people obviously put a lot of love in to, but they're buried under this partially/hastily finished mess.  The thing getting me most right now is the sound.  To keep the games weapons from screaming at me, I have to keep the SFX at 3 of 10 and it's killing any chance of immersion.  I can't hear footfalls, beastial roars, environmental sounds, really wonderful stuff that is just whisper quiet thanks to yet another unfinished segment of this title.",update outriders is officially

The game includes co-op campaigns, but also offers you to complete the co-op campaigns by yourself. They also have games modes within Destiny 2 that are challenging and fun to play. For example, the Crucible allows you to fight against other players in a free for all or in a death match against a team of players.  Gambit allows you to go up against a team of players in a primeval match. Vanguard has two modes strike and nightfall. Both strike and nightfall allow you to fight against hard bosses with your friends. Strike and nightfall in Vanguard also allow you to earn great rewards. Destiny 2 allows you to customize your character with different weapons, armor, speeders and ships. You can also use different color palettes for you weapons, armor, speeders, and ships. There are also different types of power for your character to wield (Void, Electric, and Fire). Destiny 2 also gives you an option to play as three different classes. For example, Hunter, Sorcerer, and Titan. They also have different tiers for weapons, armor, speeders, and ships. For example, they have common, rare, legendary, and last but not least ""exotic"".  They also allow you to get different customized types of ships. You can travel in space to different planets too. The quests and achievements are great to accomplish. The story line is great too. I always look forward to a great story and Destiny 2 has it. (Rest in peace Cayde)  You can form clans and go on missions with your teammates in your clan. There are all different kinds of enemies in Destiny 2 that are challenging to fight against, but you must be the right light level to fight against those enemies. There are public events in Destiny 2. These public events grant you good rewards also. I really enjoy playing this game. I recommend you to play Destiny 2 if you have not played it already.

1724,5,Sun,Mar,2023,13:12:25,Borderlands 3,"Got this game at 90% off. Played it as co-op.
As a loot game 5/10 for me, maybe 7/10 if you are a looter-shooter fans.
The game overall feels good for 1 character play through, but gets boring fast. 

I'm new to BL so the story just trash. The delivery is terrible, character buildup is non-existent, cringe antagonist, 0 immersion.

The most fun I have is during Lv.20-40. Where you start meet different mobs and guns, then you try most of them out and the fun ends. 

The mayhem system is a ""challenge"" as you progress to Lv.72 with increasing mayhem. But it cycles through good gun, falls off a lot, hope to get good gun soon, while stuck in second wind loop because there is a bullet sponge in your face but you 1 shot everything else. Once your build is nearly complete even mayhem 10 is easy. Mayhem Lv.1-10 can be good and linear for causal players but Lv. 3,5,7,9 is a pure waste of time, mayhem 1-5 would've been the same.

I'm not a fan of looter shooter in general, unless the game is well designed, i.e. good build variety/depth, good mobs, all builds just comes down to holding m1. Rarely looter-shooters do it well and it's either <1 sec fight/phase or bullet sponge snore fest.

The whole BL3 gameplay is to proc anoitment/passive with active, then hold m1 and kill boss(phase) in 1 second. Guns are all about passive proc. There is no depth to it, different guns, no matter how cool/bland, they essentially do the same thing. Mindless M1 spray and pray.

Uninteresting Mobs, not much mechanics/interactions, no attack patterns to learn, etc. There is not much to learn in BL3, the phase changes / immune phase are pointless/time stall.

Poor quest system, mostly running from A to B, press E, then run to C, repeat. 

Poor chests, they are everywhere but pointless because inflation, you only need health packs.

Poor loot tables, white green blue have 0 purpose, few purples are notable, only legendary matters.

it is a good game , but i don't think its worth 55 dollars despite being a 24 hours worth of gameplay (if you don't do side quests)

as i said i tried very hard to like this game and this is one of my first not recommended reviews
even giving it at least a week or two but it seems things are getting from bad to worst
after being 49 hours in enduring through 


crashes at every attempt to do something (ranging from connecting to game - final moments before claiming the resource pods in expedition)
inventory wipes 
poor multiplayer support
enemies phasing through walls 


(no character deletion so far) Positive ?

The hard part about the game is coming in without a guide. Honestly it's a mess. The story is finally coming along but my biggest gripe with it is, it's all verbal or read. The cutscenes are great, but barely exist. Plus a lot of the questline stuff can be confusing because of the wording. We have vanguards (leaders/mentors) in the game, but all they do is give bounties. Bungie is wasting these fantastic characters by not including them actually in game. They just stay in the tower. These vanguards should be your mentor throughout the game helping in missions or guiding you visually instead of over the radio. At least in the story, in my opinion.
The best way to get into the game is with a friend. Honestly that's about the only thing that makes the game enjoyable anyway in my opinion.

If you like the story part of the looter shooter genre this game has beautiful main cast  (other than that girl)  but more beautiful side character and their funny little stories. So when you start to play your order should go like this 
listen to the story and wait for it to end . if you trigger anything else in the meantime the story will be cut short and you will not hear anything else. So while you are doing a mission i would suggest you to not finish any challenges or side stories while the talk is continuing  because they will interlock each other and you will miss the fun parts of the game . So always wait for speech to end to complete another thing you are going for.

If you are in it for the looter shooter genre here is what you should be careful. 

LOOT DROPS OFF THE MAP. 
In every single borderlands game the general issue that has never fixed was the loots dropping of the map. So in a fight first always wait for the boss or the npc to stop moving before you kill the the moment of the enemy reflects on to the loot as well always wait for your last blow if they are jumping wait for them to land etc. sometimes some enemies will jump outside the wall and you just have to wait for them to come back. so loot doesn't go off the map or outside of map or just glich through the floor entirely. 
Always loot first shoot later. any loot can disappear from the map so when you are in a fight always get used to pressing `e` and getting the loot if not you hope for the best. If you are playing friends/co-op loot first then share later.",i just wanted to give you some heads up before you start to play this game if you like the story part of the looter shooter genre this game has beautiful main cast other than that girl but more beautiful side character and their funny little stories so when you start to play your order should go like this listen to the story and wait for it to end if you trigger anything else in the meantime the story will be cut short and you will not hear anything else so while you are doing a mission i would suggest you to not finish any challenges or side stories while the talk is continuing because they will interlock each other and you will miss the fun parts of the game so always wait for speech to end to complete another thing you are going for if you are in it for the looter shooter genre here is what you should be careful loot drops off the map in every single borderlands game the general issue that has never fixed was the loots dropping of the map so in a fight first always wait for the boss or the npc to stop moving before you kill the the moment of the enemy reflects on to the loot as well always wait for your last blow if they are jumping wait for them to land etc sometimes some enemies will jump outside the wall and you just have to wait for them to come back so loot doesn t go off the map or outside of map or just glich through the floor entirely always loot first shoot later any loot can disappear from the map so when you are in a fight always get used to pressing e and getting the loot if not you hope for the best if you are playing friends co op loot first then share later,wanted give heads start play game part looter shooter genre game beautiful cast girl beautiful side character funny stories start play order listen wait end trigger meantime cut hear mission suggest finish challenges side stories talk continuing interlock fun parts game wait speech end complete thing looter shooter genre careful loot drops map single borderlands game general issue fixed loots dropping map fight wait npc stop moving kill moment enemy reflects loot wait jumping wait enemies jump wait loot map map glich floor loot shoot loot disappear map fight pressing loot playing friends op loot share,wanted give heads start play game part looter shooter genre game beautiful cast girl beautiful side character funny stories start play order listen wait end trigger meantime cut hear mission suggest finish challenges side stories talk continuing interlock fun parts game wait speech end complete thing looter shooter genre careful loot drops map single borderlands game general issue fixed loots dropping map fight wait npc stop moving kill moment enemy reflects loot wait jumping wait enemies jump wait loot map map glich floor loot shoot loot disappear map fight pressing loot playing friends op loot share,1,0,0.0

I also didn't care for the ever increasing focus on sirens, I'd much rather just be a rag-tag group of mercs going out on treasure hunts rather than serving some plot that is way larger than me.
The planet-hopping aspect also felt off. Borderlands has allways been set in that, border lands, the edge of civilization (note that I haven't played the pre-sequel so this might not hold there). The series has allways been wide stretches of barren wastes with an architectual style best described as ""developed shanty-town"", so when I travel to futuristic cities and serene temples it just feels off. There was a developed area in BL2, but you were fighting to stop that (albeit a bit tangentially) so it feels contrary to the spirit of a vault hunter.

Upon arrival, the gang learn a ""Phantom Virus"" materialized from Eric's game and attacked him before his teacher, Professor Kaufman, drove it off with a high-powered magnet and that it has been terrorizing the campus ever since. While investigating potential suspects Eric; Kaufman; Bill, Eric's best friend and baseball-loving programmer; and grumpy campus security guard, Officer Wembley, the gang encounter the Phantom Virus before someone uses Eric's laser to beam them all into his game, where the gang learn that they must complete every level by finding a box of Scooby Snax to get out of the game.

Following initial difficulties in the first three levels, the gang progress quickly until they reach the final level, where they meet cyber-versions of themselves. After escaping from the Phantom Virus, the cyber-gang reveal that they know where to locate the final box of Scooby Snax, and lead the original gang to an amusement park, where they battle real versions of monsters that Mystery Inc. have previously faced and unmasked as human criminals. Eventually, Scooby-Doo's cyber-double distracts the Phantom Virus so the original Scooby can grab the last box of Scooby Snax, deleting the Phantom Virus and returning the gang to the real world. Using baseball-related clues they found and phrases the Phantom Virus used during their adventure, they reveal Bill as its creator. Following a failed escape attempt, he is arrested by Wembley and reveals that he was jealous that Eric's video game was chosen for the science fair over his even though he had been at the school two years longer, so he created the Phantom Virus to scare Eric away and claim the prize money for himself. Fearing that Mystery Inc. would discover he had created the virus, he beamed them into cyberspace in the hope that they would not survive.

On launch it was play with friends sort of, one or two times a match things would bug out and kick one or two. Even now relaoding takes longer then nessary to contune as one or two people are loading in and unable to help and the time to start takes far longer then it should. 
Then they talk about legendaries being dropped form the bounty hunts and the monster hunts, I have yet to get a single one in ANY of them. So maybe thats late game when that hit? 

Then my single player character bugs with the inventory glitch when I tried to play with random teams, lost all my items AND THE ABILITY TO PLAY THAT CHARACTER. Neither on single player or with teams. I cant use them and I REALLY DONT WANT TO START ALL OVER. Thats time I put in I wont be getting back.

Do I hate the game? No, I dont hate it, I really really enjoy playing it. ITs fun when it works. But the amount of nerfing they keep doing to make the game last longer is getting out of hand and not  just letting people be able to even PLAY it is getting out of hand. 
 if you want the game to last longer you add new content, wow a unique idea to the industry!

1570,10,Fri,Mar,2023,20:13:35,Borderlands 3,"At its base price ($60 at the time of writing) this game is a robbery. Borderlands 3 is worth a fraction of that price with a lot of strings attached. I got it for $6 and was able to play through it co-op, so it made the experience bearable. 

Here's what Borderlands 3 does well: Gunplay is stellar, gun design is creative, most of the music is great (except for that garbage cameo by Animal Fiction you're forced to listen to for 10 minutes), gore and sounds are just as good as previous games, and action skills have great impact. 

So what's wrong with it? It has three major flaws: Difficulty/Progression, Itemization, and Story. 

The story is nonsensical, cringe-worthy, and unfunny. The only witty dialogue is by Mr. Torgue in the optional puzzle arcade game. This wouldn't be so bad if it didn't force you to sit through the dialogue while you wait for the next door to be opened, so you can actually keep playing the game. 

The Itemization is completely over-tuned. You receive a near constant stream of Legendary items at all points in the game. Moxxi weapons are extremely cheap and outclass nearly every other weapon. This leads to a huge power disparity between weapons, making some pretty creative weapons designs nearly useless by comparison to other weapon drops. 

By the end of the campaign, I had a Legendary item equipped in every slot. The difficulty of the game is trivialized as a result, and the progression is all off. Instead of a ""True Vault Hunter Mode"" like games past, BL3 scales the entire game to your level upon completion. It also has a second playthrough that does the same thing, only with more badass enemies. The level cap is high enough that you just max every skill in your two skill trees of choice. There was never a challenging moment until well into the postgame, where you can unlock ""Mayhem Mode"". This adds some ""random"" modifiers to yourself and enemies, increases their healthpools (by as much as 10,000%), and gives more loot/money/xp. It increases the power of drops by ~9% per level (up to 137% at max difficulty), which leads to a very slow and grindy progression. 

This is more a personal gripe coming from Pre-Sequel, but I'm upset that the Slam Skills are still in the game, but completely useless until you reach ""Guardian Rank"" 100+. This is BL3's version of Baddass Ranks, and even with the absurd amounts of XP that Mayhem Mode gives, I never reached this level. 

I wouldn't recommend this unless you can get it on sale and play through it with a friend. It's a mediocre entry that is carried by the gunplay present in the previous entries.",at its base price dollar sixty at the time of writing this game is a robbery borderlands three is worth a

I watched plenty of videos telling me not to buy it, plenty of people did warn me. But, $10 is $10 right? 

The AI is horrible, to the point that I would easily mistake it for an MMO from the early 2000s. I will go into a room, shoot a guy in the face, and so long as none of his buddies see me specifically, they wont care, and I can just pick them off one by one. 

The maps are so useless to the point I was asking myself why I even bothered looking at them

Quest Dialogue is not at all helpful, I had a moment where I was trying to find a dude for a quest and it took me a good 45 minutes, and I didn't even find him, my friend eventually found him though.

This is a massive looting game, one that has you collecting junk in order to scrap for usable material, however, they give you such a low amount of carry weight, so much so that you will constantly be trying to find the nearest scrap table, because every gun  you loot is between 6-12 pounds, and you can only carry 100-200 pounds at the beginning of your experience.

Vsync is set up so that you are locked at 48 FPS, unless you edit the .ini file, BUT if you turn off Vsync using that, and have good enough hardware to go above 144FPS,  you will start to get stuck in place due to desync issues, so you have to have some kind of program outside of fallout 76 that will limit your fps for you.

It is constantly on sale which means you dont have to spend a fhitload of money, and for a new player there is a tonne of story driven game. I also have to say that it has the best community of players of any online game I have EVER played and I have played quite of those. I cant even remember how many times I have been given items by other players, and myself everytime I play I always give away food ammo and medkits to low level players just to help them play the game more easily. I even make armor or weapons of low level that I sell in my compound for free. 
     The building aspect of the game is also one of the best online. I never tire of walking around other players bases and looking at the structures people havs made. Its fantastic what players come up with...... Building is probably one of the most fun things you can do ingame.
      But ......for older players the game needs more story driven content. Not more new publik events, not more scoreboard seasons, just pure unadulterated storyline a world expansion if you will call it that and not implemented like '' the pitt'' which feels like daily ops with a twist that you have to do daily chores to enter it.
     Thats my opinion and I give it because I was asked for it. Fully recommended  way to spend your free time in front of a PC. especially if you like the fallout world.

Instead, Bethesda stretched Fallout 4 as far as they could and added multiplayer, microtransactions, a content-pass, and a battle royal game mode which is potentially the worst thing I have ever played. But is the game bad and not worth any of your time and money? I mean maybe... but I think it's worth a play.
Â 
Pros
â¢ If you like Fallout 4 and are looking for a similar experience you will probably enjoy Fallout76.
â¢ Fallout 4 is finally multiplayer!
â¢ The shelter and camp base creation tools/options are plentiful.
â¢ The paid currency ""Atoms"" is obtainable through in-game challenges.
â¢ The content pass is free.
â¢ The soundtrack is the best in a fallout game but with one glaring issue (in cons).
â¢ Quality of life updates are somewhat consistently improving the gameplay experience.
â¢ An incredibly helpful and wholesome community.Â 
â¢ Still fun solo but great fun with a group.
Â 
Cons
â¢ All bugs from fallout 4 are here.
â¢ I have had many issues with missions not progressing thus needing to abandon the mission.
â¢ The radio host is so annoying that I don't listen to the radio.
â¢ The ""Nuclear Winter"" battle royale mode is so broken that it's hilarious.
â¢ Fallout first.
â¢ Not having enough storage (they just increased from 800 to 1200)
â¢ The ""Plans"" required to craft many items are not shared between characters.
â¢ Hit registration is very poor and makes melee unreliable and just plain bad.
â¢ I lag almost everywhere in Nuclear Winter rarely getting above 60fps

After playing consistently for the past month, I can comfortably say that I do not regret my decision for purchasing at less than 20 Canadian Rubles on sale. BUT BE WARNED: If you are looking for a different Fallout experience this is not it.

Also as you mentioned in the video the reused bosses, assets, and so movesets bothers me too. The open world really feels pointless and bland like in Ubisoft games. Souls like games works best as linear dungeon crawlers like the dark souls games. Or semi open world like sekiro. During my first run I did an all bosses playthrough I just keep stopping to play other things since I found the bosses in this game so boring and easy compared to the other souls games. But 1 thing for sure is whenever I play the game again, I CANNOT bring myself to do any of the optional bosses again whereas in every other souls like game fromsoft made I do every bit of content available. Iâm glad fromsoft are taking a break from souls likes games to do armor core.

64979,21,Sat,Aug,2021,00:06:49,Outriders,"This game gets a lot of shit, but let me write a realistic review: [b]It's not a service looter shooter[/b], like Warframe is

Think of Borderlands. Excellent series, gameplay, weapon variety, etc. (my favorite is 3, so use that as a comparison)

You do main story with friends, try out different classes, builds, equipment. Now you're in a good spot. A good 60 hours in maybe. So you continue min-maxing, farming loot/gear. Now at endgame we're playing through harder content such as raids, expeditions, events, and other specific game modes. 120 hours later, you sure got your money's worth

That's what this game is, and it certainly excels in providing entertainment. You do story with friends. Progress gear. Try different classes. Make different builds. Farm perfect rolls for your build. Change builds. Farm a new gear set for a different build. Collect more weapons. Farm for higher rolls of said weapons. Farm for resources in order to continue min-maxing. Run expeditions-type content

It's a time killer at that, story is quite good. Weapon variety isn't as exciting as borderlands but still fine. More classes would be nice, but BL3 also had a comparable amount, which isn't really a complaint. I'd say class diversity is better in BL3, but it's fine here too

But for fks sake. I'm sick of the crybabies. Maybe I'm just easy to please, maybe I'm in the minority when I don't feel the need to btch about crap when it's fine. Yes, we know what we paid for. I get it. But apparently a lot of players don't

Now, if someone understands this, but still doesn't like it, then that's different. It's just not for them and that's okay. It's not supposed to be for everyone. Maybe they want it to be more technical. Maybe more story. Maybe more skill variety. Maybe more optimized for their potato. Maybe they don't have much free time so they want the rng improved

However... $60? Subjectively worth it cheaper. But for me at 150 hours, at $60, I got more than the value out of it. 

Anyway, I recommend it, just like I'd recommend BL3 (though I dumped 100 hours more into bl3)",this game gets a lot of shit but let me write a realistic review b it s not a service looter shooter b like warframe is think of borderlands excellent series gameplay weapon variety etc my favorite is three so use that as a comparison you do main story with friends try out different classes builds equipment now you re in a good spot a good sixty hours in maybe so you continue min maxing farming loot gear now at endgame we re playing through harder content such as raids expeditions events and other specific game modes one hundred and twenty hours later you sure got your money s worth that s what this game is and it certainly excels in providing entertainment you do story with friends progress gear try different classes make different builds farm perfect rolls for your build change builds farm a new gear set for a different build collect more weapons farm for higher rolls of said weapons farm for resources in order to continue min maxing run expeditions type content it s a time killer at that story is quite good weapon variety isn t as exciting as borderlands but still fine more classes would be nice but blthree also had a comparable amount which isn t really a complaint i d say class diversity is better in blthree but it s fine here too but for fks sake i m sick of the crybabies maybe i m just easy to please maybe i m in the minority when i don t feel the need to btch about crap when it s fine yes we know what we paid for i get it but apparently a lot of players don t now if someone understands this but still doesn t like it then that s different it s just not for them and that s okay it s not supposed to be for everyone maybe they want it to be more technical maybe more story maybe more skill variety maybe more optimized for their potato maybe they don t have much free time so they want the rng improved however dollar sixty subjectively worth it cheaper but for me at one hundred and fifty hours at dollar sixty i got more than the value out of it anyway i recommend it just like i d recommend blthree though i dumped one hundred hours more into blthree,game lot shit write realistic review service looter shooter warframe borderlands excellent series gameplay weapon variety favorite comparison friends classes builds equipment spot hours continue maxing farming loot gear endgame playing content raids expeditions events specific game modes hours game excels providing entertainment friends progress gear classes make builds farm perfect rolls build change builds farm gear set build collect weapons farm higher rolls weapons farm resources order continue maxing run expeditions type content time killer weapon variety exciting borderlands classes nice blthree comparable amount complaint class diversity blthree fks sake sick crybabies easy minority feel btch crap paid apparently lot players understands supposed technical skill variety optimized potato time rng improved subjectively cheaper hours recommend recommend blthree dumped hours blthree,game lot shit write realistic review service looter shooter warframe borderlands excellent series gameplay weapon variety favorite comparison friends classes builds equipment spot hours continue maxing farming loot gear endgame playing content raids expeditions events specific game modes hours game excels providing entertainment friends progress gear classes make builds farm perfect rolls build change builds farm gear set build collect weapons farm higher rolls weapons farm resources order continue maxing run expeditions type content time killer weapon variety exciting borderlands classes nice blthree comparable amount complaint class diversity blthree fks sake sick crybabies easy minority feel btch crap paid apparently lot players understands supposed technical skill variety optimized potato time rng improved subjectively cheaper hours recommend recommend blthree dumped hours blthree,1,1,0.50993377

The only real issue (other than a few bugs) that most early bad reviews complained about were/are server connectivity issues. Even I had some issues connecting in the first couple days but the developers have been hard at work fixing all known/reported issues and the game now runs nearly flawlessly. I can play for hours without disconnecting all night and the game runs 'buttery' smooth. The only issue I occasionally have is every once in a while game crash or a few light bugs but they do not occur often to justify the game is 'unplayable' or to leave a negative review. 

The story is fairly interesting, the graphics and level of detail is top notch, but the best part (in my opinion) about this game is the combat...I love it! I am playing the Trickster class and the combat is very fast paced/action packed; the sound effects, the explosions, the differences in weapons, all great. I'm honestly hooked and look forward to every chance I can jump on and make more progress. 

If you are considering this game then I highly recommend you at a minimum download/play the free demo. If you like the demo you can even pick up where you left off in the demo. The game in my opinion is worth the $60 price tag.

I will say the good stuff about this game is that despite it being on survival mode by default, with no way to change it, I do like it and it does make the game feel a bit more immersive. The map of the game and the locations within it are also pretty neat with it having visually unique locations, even if it isn't a 1:1 of West Virginia.
Now the issues with this game is that it is mostly spent grinding, and the items to grind are also a pain in the ass to get, and with you as the player always needing to repair your items, then the item that you got through grinding is needed again and rinse and repeat. Another issue with the game is that it's just not fun at all.
I wanna just lastly say that I think the game is still a buggy mess, but definitely not how it used to be, now it just crashed once every dozen of hours, but the game usually crashed when you boot it up but works again when you try again.

The grind isn't so bad as long as you have time to do so, and the free to play element at least in PVE seems viable without having to sink a lot of money into expansions unless you want to.

The issue I have with the game is the higher end PVE, and just about all aspects of PVP, most of the criticisms about the community of this game itself

In a lot of high end PVE, you will find that the community is selfish, they only want loot, they do not care about teamwork, or reviving you even if it causes a wipe, and if it's a grandmaster you will have a bad time if you LFG.

In PVP the same 3 or 4 broken weapons tend to get used, and cheaters still run rampant even after the anti-cheat was put into place. Shotguns are about all you will see in crucible now, and the community is so toxic that you should expect to get teabagged every match.

Doing raids is a pain, I have been doing them for years, and they can take 10 to 14 hours with people who refuse to help or listen..

TLDR: Playing with randos in this game with result in a bad time, the community is as toxic as they come.
If you plan on getting it, try out the free to play aspect for a week to see if it clicks before spending any money on the expansions.

Play it with friends if possible.

I know there is NG+ and PVP but nothing will ever come close to that first full play-through. I encourage you to step out of your gaming comfort zone and try Elden Ring, for it will be an experience like no other.

Better hope you randomised into one of the 5-6 exotic weapons and armours in the game that are essential for CTs 12-15 else good f'ing luck. I've tried firepower and anomaly builds and without the stupid broken mods, you simply don't do enough damage. Then I switched into a broken gun (given as 'pre-order bonus', which while just Epic, dishes out so much DPS, you one shot most enemies in the head).

But... EVEN IF YOU DO ENOUGH DAMAGE, you always risk getting unavoidably 2-shot by enemies. Brood Mothers can just swipe twice through armour, each swipe hitting for 80% of your health. Oh and you'll be staggered for 3 seconds that entire time and all the other enemies will dish out their normal damage, while you can't even roll...

There is no resistance to knockback either. That benefit is reserved only for the enemies. You just get infinite CC by charging enemies or every elite having a stomp attack because the people who made this game are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ rank amateurs.

Save your money, or refund it if you just bought this game. They do a balance patch nerfing one class into the ground, while I was boosting 2 of my friends on T15 without any issues... meanwhile I literally can't progress at my other character (T13/14, in mostly 48/49 gear) because I am missing all of the core mods, which are NOT share between characters... That means you have to farm the fukken mods on all characters from scratch and if you don't find the right legendary weapons to disassemble, well that's tough luck and your luck sucks.

Only way to get them is to drop the difficulty by like 5 tiers, only i still am threatened with being 2 shot at lower tiers. You also get a fraction of your resources too, so that's fun.

CT15 legendary drop rate is supposedly 20% chance for 4 items (each having 20% chance to be a legendary) at gold time... After doing 6 runs in a row, 3-5 minutes under the gold time, me and my mates did not get a SINGLE legendary item... 20%!!! It should say 0.2%!

If you got this far, â¥â¥â¥â¥ the people who made this game. They don't know what they are doing. Just pass on this, even on a Steam game sale.

After those patches I stopped bothering and moved onto other games. I used to watch the patches with hope that they might get better, but the pattern continued so I moved on. Today, I saw the current sale on the front page and decided to write this review.

13530,9,Mon,Aug,2021,23:27:09,Borderlands 3,"Holy cow where do I start?

First to address many of the other reviews, YES I get it, Ava is annoying but not that bad of a character. After reading some of these reviews you'd think she kidnapped and then cooked, then ate your dog. Chill out. I think Balex is much more of an annoying character then Ava. 

This at it's core is Borderlands, the first fun looter shooter on the planet. The gameplay is great, the classes are all interesting and to me all have fun ways to play. Although, Fl4k is by far my favorite. The NPC interactions can get very annoying. With a title like this you'd think there would be more then 3 different dialogs by some of the NPCs. 

Guns, GUNS GUNS! The guns in Borderlands 3 are by far my favorite of the entire franchise.  You're bound to find a gun not long in the game that you just absolutely love and never want to get rid of. (until it becomes absolutely worthless after you've leveled a few times. They'd probably do more damage if you could just throw it at the baddies.) 

The story is pretty good, being able to visit different locations in the Borderlands universe and seeing familiar faces from previous titles, gives me a good nostalgic feeling. I just wish there was more with Tiny Tina, she stole the show in Borderlands 2, but is just kind of a foot note in this game. 

I haven't had much for crashes or glitches save one.  There is one particular area that you have to jump on platforms however you have to jump on a particular spot or you just fall through the platform and have to start over. 

I've always enjoyed the Borderlands graphics, and this one does not disappoint. You can tell they worked hard on the players, NPCs, environments and weapons. It's hard pressed to see a lot of the same animations.  

My biggest complaint isn't so much the game, but how Gearbox approached adding more DLC. Some people forked out over $130 for this game at launch to think they are getting everything Borderlands 3 will ever be. Only for Gearbox to flip it and want another $50 for more DLC.  This kind of changed my view of the company, from being a superb developer to being just like everyone else. Shame on you Gearbox, shame on you.

Overall this is a solid title, with lots of potential for years to come. There are multiple mayhem levels with increase difficulty and can bring immunity to some damages, or create a pool of fire if you stand still too long, and better loot. I wouldn't say this game is perfect but it's definitely a 9/10.",holy cow where do i start first to address many of the other reviews yes i get it ava is annoying but not that bad of a character after reading some of these reviews you d think she kidnapped and then cooked then ate your dog chill out i think balex is much more of an annoying character then ava this at it s core is borderlands the first fun looter shooter on the planet the gameplay is great the classes are all interesting and to me all have fun ways to play although fl4k is by far my favorite the npc interactions can get very annoying with a title like this you d think there would be more then three different dialogs by some of the npcs guns guns guns the guns in borderlands three are by far my favorite of the entire franchise you re bound to find a gun not long in the game that you just absolutely love and never want to get rid of until it becomes absolutely worthless after you ve leveled a few times they d probably do more damage if you could just throw it at the baddies the story is pretty good being able to visit different locations in the borderlands universe and seeing familiar faces from previous titles gives me a good nostalgic feeling i just wish there was more with tiny tina she stole the show in borderlands two but is just kind of a foot note in this game i haven t had much for crashes or glitches save one there is one particular area that you have to jump on platforms however you have to jump on a particular spot or you just fall through the platform and have to start over i ve always enjoyed the borderlands graphics and this one does not disappoint you can tell they worked hard on the players npcs environments and weapons it s hard pressed to see a lot of the same animations my biggest complaint isn t so much the game but how gearbox approached adding more dlc some people forked out over dollar 1three0 for this game at launch to think they are getting everything borderlands three will ever be only for gearbox to flip it and want another dollar fifty for more dlc this kind of changed my view of the company from being a superb developer to being just like everyone else shame on you gearbox shame on you overall this is a solid title with lots of potential for years to come there are multiple mayhem levels with increase difficulty and can bring immunity to some damages or create a pool of fire if you stand still too long and better loot i wouldn t say this game is perfect but it s definitely a nine ten,holy cow start address reviews annoying bad character reading reviews kidnapped cooked ate dog chill balex annoying character borderlands fun looter shooter planet gameplay great classes interesting fun ways play fl4k favorite npc interactions annoying title dialogs npcs guns guns guns guns borderlands favorite entire franchise bound find gun game absolutely rid absolutely worthless leveled times damage throw baddies pretty visit locations borderlands universe familiar faces previous titles nostalgic feeling stole show borderlands kind foot note game crashes glitches save area jump platforms jump spot fall platform start enjoyed borderlands graphics disappoint worked hard players npcs environments weapons hard pressed lot animations biggest complaint game gearbox approached adding dlc people forked 1three0 game launch borderlands gearbox flip dlc kind changed view company superb developer shame gearbox shame solid title lots potential years multiple mayhem levels increase difficulty bring immunity damages create fire stand loot game perfect,holy cow start address reviews annoying bad character reading reviews kidnapped cooked ate dog chill balex annoying character borderlands fun looter shooter planet gameplay great classes interesting fun ways play fl4k favorite npc interactions annoying title dialogs npcs guns guns guns guns borderlands favorite entire franchise bound find gun game absolutely rid absolutely worthless leveled times damage throw baddies pretty visit locations borderlands universe familiar faces previous titles nostalgic feeling stole show borderlands kind foot note game crashes glitches save area jump platforms jump spot fall platform start enjoyed borderlands graphics disappoint worked hard players npcs environments weapons hard pressed lot animations biggest complaint game gearbox approached adding dlc people forked 1three0 game launch borderlands gearbox flip dlc kind changed view company superb developer shame gearbox shame solid title lots potential years multiple mayhem levels increase difficulty bring immunity damages create fire stand loot game perfect,1,4,0.515057385

From the get go you are locked into playing on ""Easy"" or ""Normal"" difficulty, which sounds fine, at least there are options, right? My friends and I have played Borderlands before so we opted for Normal difficulty. After about 5 hours of playing, the game no longer posed any sort of challenge whats so ever. ""Legendary"" hunts were one tapped, Bosses were only saved the same humiliation by forced invulnerability phases, and trash mobs exploded into pieces in a single shot.  The advice offered by the Internet was to purposefully handicap yourself to enjoy the game, which sounded insane to me. 

Now if you are returning borderlands players something you probably expect is a certain level of polish in the game... This latest installment throws that out the window.  Its not like we are playing on release, but the litany of issues we ran into was  beyond frustrating and turned the game into a bigger chore than it had to be.  Multiplayer meant we constantly had invisible name tags, As Fl4k my friends (and myself) were constantly shooting my pet because of this, Fast Travel icons have to be clicked in a certain way otherwise they dont work, audio glitches causing repeated voice lines (You can make it through, I believe in you. Stealth slide! - Claptrap x 100). You get the hint, polish went from like a 95 in Bl2 to a 60 in Bl3. 

Story is crap, everyone mentions it, no point me mentioning it. Sure its hard to follow Handsome Jack, but damn, what a nosedive. 

Overall a bad experience, between the story, the bugs, the character assassination, and the complete joke of a normal difficulty, I just cant recommend this game, especially if you have played any of the previous BL titles.",i wanted to like this game and i mean really wanted to but honestly this was a slog to get through from the get go you are locked into playing on easy or normal difficulty which sounds fine at least there are options right my friends and i have played borderlands before so we opted for normal difficulty after about five hours of playing the game no longer posed any sort of challenge whats so ever legendary hunts were one tapped bosses were only saved the same humiliation by forced invulnerability phases and trash mobs exploded into pieces in a single shot the advice offered by the internet was to purposefully handicap yourself to enjoy the game which sounded insane to me now if you are returning borderlands players something you probably expect is a certain level of polish in the game this latest installment throws that out the window its not like we are playing on release but the litany of issues we ran into was beyond frustrating and turned the game into a bigger chore than it had to be multiplayer meant we constantly had invisible name tags as fl4k my friends and myself were constantly shooting my pet because of this fast travel icons have to be clicked in a certain way otherwise they dont work audio glitches causing repeated voice lines you can make it through i believe in you stealth slide claptrap x one hundred you get the hint polish went from like a 9five in bl2 to a sixty in bl3 story is crap everyone mentions it no point me mentioning it sure its hard to follow handsome jack but damn what a nosedive overall a bad experience between the story the bugs the character assassination and the complete joke of a normal difficulty i just cant recommend this game especially if you have played any of the previous bl titles,wanted game wanted honestly slog locked playing easy normal difficulty sounds options friends played borderlands opted normal difficulty hours playing game longer posed sort challenge whats legendary hunts tapped bosses saved humiliation forced invulnerability phases trash mobs exploded pieces single shot advice offered internet purposefully handicap enjoy game sounded insane returning borderlands players expect level polish game latest installment throws window playing release litany issues ran frustrating turned game bigger chore multiplayer meant constantly invisible tags fl4k friends constantly shooting pet travel icons clicked dont work audio glitches causing repeated voice lines make stealth slide claptrap hint polish 9five bl2 bl3 crap mentions point mentioning hard follow handsome damn nosedive bad experience bugs character assassination complete joke normal difficulty recommend game played previous bl titles,wanted game wanted honestly slog locked playing easy normal difficulty sounds options friends played borderlands opted normal difficulty hours playing game longer posed sort challenge whats legendary hunts tapped bosses saved humiliation forced invulnerability phases trash mobs exploded pieces single shot advice offered internet purposefully handicap enjoy game sounded insane returning borderlands players expect level polish game latest installment throws window playing release litany issues ran frustrating turned game bigger chore multiplayer meant constantly invisible tags fl4k friends constantly shooting pet travel icons clicked dont work audio glitches causing repeated voice lines make stealth slide claptrap hint polish 9five bl2 bl3 crap mentions point mentioning hard follow handsome damn nosedive bad experience bugs character assassination complete joke normal difficulty recommend game played previous bl titles,0,2,0.524348795
42394,13,Tue,Dec,2022,18:55:09,Fallout 76,"TLDR: This game has a few serious bugs, and customer support either cannot or else they will not help. Don't put yourself through the frustrations. This isn't like other Fallout games. Enjoy the others, but give this one a pass. :(

Details:

I have played Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 4, and even Fallout Shelter. Both on PC, and on Xbox 360 and Xbox 1x.

Each game had some challenges, and a learning curve ... at least, for someone with similar disabilities. 

There would likely be fewer difficulties for healthy people, but I had already become disabled before I began playing these. There were frustrations at the beginning of each game, though those frustrations faded as my characters gained levels and skills, and obtained better gear.

In the end, the prior Fallout games all became fun. I enjoyed them, and I have often returned to playing them.

I had hoped for a similar experience in Fallout 76.

Unfortunately ...

I gave this game two months, and nearly 500 hours of play time. I even trusted them enough to buy some stuff from their real money transaction store, largely based on those earlier games and the overall positive experience.

Fallout 76 was a bigger struggle.

My disabilities include sluggish reflexes, and shaky hands, along with several other ""inconveniences"" that have less impact on playing games. So the lack of a ""very easy"" setting was a significant obstacle, for me.

Even with all those challenges, I managed to reach level 50. I had gradually found all 5 pieces needed to assemble a full set of power armor. I (barely) beat two quests that required that armor. I mostly sneak and snipe, though some situations do not allow for those tactics to be used. For those situations, power armor is absolutely necessary.

I found a few more pieces of power armor on a second ""chassis."" I took these discoveries back to my C.A.M.P., to compare the new pieces with what I already had. I wanted a safe place to learn if I had discovered any upgrades.

... and the game ate my power armor. The chassis, all 5 pieces of armor I had previously obtained, and one of the new pieces - poof! All vanished, as I tried to equip the first piece I had identified as an upgrade. :(

Apparently, the policy is that customer service NEVER gives back anything lost ... unless it was bought from the ""atom shop"" (the real money transaction store).

The form letter only said ""sorry for the inconvenience,"" when repeating that they don't return ""lost"" items. It also included something that should really have been in the game menus from the beginning: a link to where one reports bugs.

No, customer service department does not forward bug reports to the developers. Players must do this manually.

It was such a struggle for me, with my disabilities, to get that power armor. I spent money from my meager disability income on the game, trusting I would be treated well if any troubles arose.

I'm heartbroken. I feel almost as if I have been writing to ""Vault Tec.""

I don't think I can play Fallout 76 anymore.

I know that other folks have continued playing Fallout 76 since its early days. I have seen characters with levels over 1000. I can only imagine that most of them belong to healthy players. Or, at least, players healthy enough that it's not such a constant struggle for them to play this game.

Considering the magnitude of the bug - taking away gear that is essential to the game - and the lack of any method to restore what the bug stole from my character, it seems like any further interaction with this game would only be a waste of time and energy.

Unfortunately, refunds are unlikely.

For my character ... R.I.P. Not her fault that the universe into which she was born is so unwelcoming and unsympathetic. I'm not talking about the in-game side, where such lack was to be expected. I am talking about the real-world lack of customer service when a serious bug messed up her capacity to function in that game world.

Please, at least if you have any physical challenges, don't put yourself through the same frustrations.

Happy gaming ... playing other games.",tldr this game has a few serious bugs and customer support either cannot or else they will not help don t put yourself through the frustrations this isn t like

64829,15,Wed,Sep,2021,07:40:56,Outriders,"The story is fantastic. That's about it.

The Cons:
1. Cover was basically pointless.
2. There were too many times dialogue would skip on its own.
3. There were too many times cut scenes would just freak out and jump forward, skipping stuff altogether. 
4. There were too many times navigation sent me the wrong way. Was forced to re-log to correct it.
5. The 3/5 second transition cut scenes are absolutely pointless. Instead of integrating the action, it loads the cut scene, then loads the next area. Think like Monster Hunter World, but every time you squeezed through someplace it loaded the squeeze then the next place.
6. Crashed a few times with no known reason.

Pros:
1. I loved the story. It's fantastic
2. Some characters are shallow, but some are very deep. Kind like real life.
3. [spoiler]Tiago's smile.[/spoiler]
4. I liked the abilities. You can really make a build around anything.
5. Guns are meh. They're just a way to trigger abilities or mods.
6. The game loaded fast on my SSD despite the many times it had to.

[spoiler] The fact the Caravel built a better engine rather than having time travel be a thing due to the anomaly feels like a big miss. I seriously was hoping time travel was involved. No, sleeping in cryo is not time travel. It's just a theatrical skip to the good part. [/spoiler]

In respect of multiplayer I have no trouble finding a team during operations (after main story) at all, 5-7 second wait, don't let the lack of multiplayer in the main story put you off it's easy to find a team after that, however once you have found a good team if you crash - and you do crash - often, unless you have them as friends its back to another random team.

The final big issue for me is X-Play not working.

Without this feature - that actually worked well for me in the Demo, I doubt I would have purchased the game as I intended to play with family/friends who are Xboxer's.

Once they fix the Unreal Engine crashes (which at the moment there is no fix for that works for me despite spending many hours trying) and Xplay is enabled it will transform the feelings I have for the game, but my patience won't last forever....

19736,9,Sat,Jan,2021,05:26:53,Borderlands 3,"One could accurately critique the Borderlands series for repeating itself in an iterative fashion in much the same way as the Assassin's Creed series, although for some reason, I just can't bring myself to dislike these games as much as I now find myself hating each new AC release. But perhaps that's down to the fact that we're at Borderlands 3, not Borderlands 26. 

With a 5 year gap between this game and the Pre-Sequel, and a 7 year gap since Borderlands 2, I found myself returning to the series like one puts on an old, beloved piece of clothing. Is it more of the same? Yeah, largely. But that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable, or even comforting to return to Pandora, and meet your old friends. 

Something about Borderlands 3 struck me as the finest distillation of the games systems and design. I found the loot drops to be more useful - I was hanging onto superb weapons that I was receiving at fairly regular intervals, instead of constantly switching them out for something that did barely more damage all the time. I also found the humour in this game to be...well, 'better' isn't the right word...but it didn't make me cringe or roll my eyes as I had before. Perhaps it was nostalgia that warmed me to the lame jokes, or perhaps it was just that the writing wasn't *quite* as tryhard as it has been in the past, but I found myself regularly laughing out loud in a way I never really did before. This, coupled with the fact that the characterisations of new and old characters has actually been given some thought, and relationships between them have been fleshed out, make this game feel like 'the gang' is really getting back together - like a big family has grown over the course of the series. And given that the only time the player witnesses the development of those relationships is here, after they've developed, I'd call it a tremendous effort to make me genuinely believe that these firm ride-or-die friendships have grown without actually showing me their growth. Committed and pitch-perfect voice performances assist greatly, and add loads and loads of life to what could otherwise be seen as a 1-dimensional world comprised of a collection of rather stale systems. 

That is, if the small changes the developer has made to the gunplay, the loot, and to the ability to completely customise your powers in order to create a build comprised of multiple different talents from multiple different skill tiers, hadn't so profoundly and positively changed the gameplay experience. There's a much more pronounced interplay between the world, the systems, and the colourful characters painted atop it. Dialogue helps bridge the gaps between story moments and the long stretches of shooting galleries that are themselves elevated by the way your skills and your weapons compliment one another, so, like a podcast on a long bus ride, turn what could be a mundane activity into something both anticipated and enjoyed. 

That said, the game is far too long, and there is little direct payoff to chasing down all the secrets and finding all the hidden collectables. I spent 33 hours in the game and got less than a third of the achievements, and there's just not enough impetus when playing on your own to aim any higher. It was starting to feel long in the tooth at the 23 hour mark, and although I appreciated the ambition of the game's constant upping of the ante, what that amounts to in real terms is another 10 hours of the same old side quests and shooting galleries. And, in the final act, one of the worst missions in any Borderlands game. I'm sorry, I have to talk about it.

If you've played it, you might know what I'm talking about - the Alternate Reality 'playtest' of a broken, microtransaction-riddled game that happens on the game's final planet. Putting aside the fact that it makes no sense for this mission to occur in a location that is supposed to be hidden away from all but one corporation, the joke is that the AR game in question is tedious and badly designed, and forces you to use fake microtransactions to speed it up. 'The Games Industry', am I right? 

But this is a game made by Gearbox - the guys who made Aliens: Colonial Marines. This is a game published by 2K - one of the worst offenders in the video games industry when it comes to predatory microtransactions. Borderlands 3 is buggy to the point that I couldn't tell if certain bugs in a mission designed to be incredibly buggy were actually just bugs in Borderlands 3. The game itself has paid DLC that should have been a free update. And Gearbox Software is run by Randy Pitchford - a literal piece of human garbage and one of the worst corporate executives in the industry's history. So as you're slogging through this awful mess, you're forced to degrade your character by paying in-game cash in order to access features that are otherwise locked off. But...the companies that are making this observation are not only directly, in the real world, inconveniencing you, the player, but have themselves paywalled content that should otherwise be free in this very game. You're not degrading your character, you're degrading yourself. 

So what's the joke here? That fetch quests are bad. That pointless boss battles are bad. That microtransactions are bad. That bugs are bad. That predatory business practices are bad. Every single one of these things is unironically on display in Borderlands 3. So the mission itself transforms from a joking commentary, to an actual demonstration of this game's own worst features, at the expense of the player's time. It's not sarcasm when it's just a rote retelling of the thing you're intending to make fun of. Yeah, those things suck. But this game has all of those things in it. So pig-ignorant are Gearbox and 2K of their own awfulness, that one of the longest side-missions in the game effectively equates to them pointing at a mirror and laughing at the guy pointing back. But really, the only person that suffers for it is you. 

It's really a statement that players that will put up with anything when sunk-cost is a factor, and it single-handedly forced me to go back and reassess much of the game I'd played. So potent is this mission's awfulness, so stark a chore it is, and so, so many hours into the games' runtime is it that it forced me to stop ignoring how much of a chore so many prominent missions in the game were. 

Borderlands 3 is, by most metrics, a better game that all of its predecessors. But it is still a Borderlands game, and by that I mean that it is only ever iterative, at times uninspired, and a lot less interesting when played alone. It has more heart and soul in its writing and characters, and while the series' systems defined a genre, it was its world and characters that lifted the game beyond its basic foundation. Borderlands 3 has more of that in spades. But don't expect a game that won't waste your time now and then. Don't expect a game that isn't, for all its stated awareness of the industry's problems, a stark example of most of those problems at one point or another. And don't play the god-damn AR mission.",one could accurately critique the borderlands series for repeating itself in an iterative fashion in much the same way as the assassin s creed series although

37373,28,Sat,Jan,2023,17:57:06,Elden Ring,"Bought this when it first got discounted on Steam and after finishing the game I regretted not paying the full price. It's the sheer amount of content and build possibilities that make this game so great. And, of course, the visual. That moment when you first stepped out of the church and see the Erdtree... It's just so beautiful. When I finished the game (and the subsequent NG+) all I can think about is how much I wished I can experience Elden Ring for the first time again.

The main dungeons are fun and creative. Fromsoft did a good job giving each main areas character. They always feel fresh. The side dungeons do get repetitive after a while but they're always worth exploring. Some bosses are reskin of another boss but I don't really mind that; it's good practice.

The open world setting is also super nice especially for people who are new to the Souls genre. It allows us to explore other areas first, getting better acquainted with various mechanics in the game and possibly use those mechanics to beat that boss we're stuck at. For example, I got stuck on Rennala on my first playthrough as an Astrologer until I decided to explore Caelid and found Rock Sling and Meteorite Staff. Made the encounter so much easier.

All in all, an exceptional game you'd want to play at least once in your life.

109768,30,Thu,Dec,2021,21:45:03,Destiny 2,"Across all platforms I have around 1.5k hours played so it's safe to say I like it. This review is going to be more of way for me to break things down for new players and what I think makes it worth playing. There's a lot of text, but if you're truly on the fence about downloading this F2P game, I'll try my best to give you everything you need to know. [b]TL;DR:[/b] It's free. Play it and see if you like it. If you like it, buy the DLCs(if you can only afford one, make it either Beyond Light or preorder The Witch Queen). If you don't like it, uninstall it and play a game you do like. 

[h1]The Negatives[/h1]
This game can 100% be played in a casual way. You can log on once a week, play for an hour or two, and hop off and have a lot of fun. Just know, however, that you [b]will not[/b] get the full experience. Is this inherently a negative? I guess not, if you have fun then it's time well spent, but you will likely not see any endgame activities(or at least not for a long long time). Raids and dungeons are some of the best content this game has to offer. They're where some of my favorite memories of this game are made. Leveling requires a good amount of grinding spread over several week, and if you don't know the pro tips on power-leveling it'll take even longer.

On the topic of ""full experience"", you will need to spend money if you want to want to have all the weapons/armor/activities. Every year we get a new DLC that adds a new, large update of story content and locations. In between these DLCs are seasons which are about 3 months of content drip fed over the course of the season. You can totally be a F2P player and still have fun, but you'll see people use a lot of cool stuff and shoot a lot of cool guns that you can never own because they payed the toll and you did not. I've played a lot of Destiny and I can tell you that the DLC(if you like the game) is super fuckin' solid.

Content Droughts, or spans of time with no new content, are a part of the life cycle of the game. Especially at the end of a season, there will be about a month or so where nothing new is added. While on paper this is a negative, I use it as a break. You don't play a video game for enough time to fill up over 2 months without taking breaks without hating it.

This is one of the biggest things for new lights. The learning curve is pretty high. This series has been going on for almost 10 years so it kind of expects you to know things. If you're a D1 vet you may not realize, but this game does a shitty job of telling you what's what. After you finish the intro mission, they dump you off in the tower and expect you to know what you have available. The build crafting, the way rolls work, even things like when or where activities take place are only slightly mentioned if at all. The second you're done with the intro the game assumes you've been playing since Day 1 D1. If you have any friends who play D2, please hit them up and ask them to show you around. They'll love talking about the game and you'll have an easier time getting to a point where you understand the basics. If you don't have anyone who plays D2, hit [i]me[/i] up! I love talking about the game and I will take any excuse to do it!

Not really a negative, but because of the longevity of the series you'll have a lot of reading to do regarding the story so far. There are a lot of obscure lore tabs and story beats that are not addressed straight up but add a lot of needed context to the stuff that is. Depending on the type of person you are this may actually be a positive, but it's just more time commitment to something that requires a big time commitment. 

PvP feels unbalanced. I put feels because if you're using the right build and the right weapons, it feels significantly less unbalanced. There are things that are just factually better, and if you're just going into PvP with whatever you have after a handful of hours you're going to get dogged on. If you put no effort into making your character built for PvP you will likely get creamed in PvP. We could argue all day about how trash Crucible is, but at the end of the day if you're using the same mods you use in a Nightfall then part of the issue is on your end(and that's an issue in and of itself)


[h1]Positives[/h1]
The missions, strikes, dungeons and raids are some of the best I've played. Level design, enemy design, AI, and weapon design work together in perfect harmony to make it an absolute joy to play. Which is good, because you're gonna be playing the same things a lot during content droughts. 

The story is so fucking good, man. This has some of my favorite world building in any media and is something I aspire to in my own writing. I love every character to some degree, some of them are mentioned only in text. Hell, some of the best stories told are hidden behind weapon descriptions. In the past year, Bungie has really stepped up their story telling and has made the price of seasons far more justifiable than before. Going into Witch Queen I am so hyped to see what's next. If you're interested in reading the lore, a website called Ishtar Collective has all of the text on it. If you want to read people throw around theories or just show appreciation for the story, visit r/destinylore on reddit.

The build crafting is a lot of fun. I will log on specifically to try on new mods and try to find synergies with different exotics and weapons I like. It's honestly game changing the way mods shift the way you play, and the amount of mods means that you'll be changing your play style often. The downside as a new player though is that a lot of these mods are only drip fed through vendors on a weekly basis. To be effective in PvP you [i]need[/i] to have mods. Read the last point in negatives as to why this might be a big deal for you. 

If you like the original Halo games, you know how well Bungie does gun play. Weapons and abilities feel good and are fun to use. Movement isn't as good as, say, Apex Legends, but D2's shootin' feels real good man. You hold left click and have fun, whaddya want?

Customization is great after you play long enough to have stuff to customize with. We're living in the golden age of Armor Synthesis(or transmog). Once you pick up a piece of armor you can visit everyone's 3rd favorite mommy Ada-1 to get a consumable that will make that armor an ornament you can put on any other armor to make it look like the other one. There's some debate about the way Bungie monetized this system, but you get 10 free ornaments a season locked behind really easy quests, and as a new player this is more than enough so you'll survive.

The art team at Bungie does their job with surgical precision. Weapons look good. Armor looks good. The skyboxes?? Don't get me fuckin' started, bro. This game looks so good, but doesn't do the thing where it's all shaders and photo realism that makes your GPU wanna jump off a bridge. If you have a potato, a glass of water and a pair of jumper cables, you can play this game at 30 fps and it'll look better than most games at the same settings.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
Just download it and play it. If you have someone who'll show you around cool, but you're probably an adult so just figure it out, man. If you like it then welcome! If you don't, it was free so you get what you pay for I guess. There is a metric fuck ton of content to help you get started, so the biggest barrier to entry is your willingness to learn.

I'm also sick of open world games. I played too many of those, and frankly, I don't have time for them any more. I just want a good game I can enjoy in small sessions.

Recently I wanted to play a good FPS game and tried Halo Infinite campaign on my new rig. 
I didn't like it, something felt off to me. I hated the enemy design, grunts especially. I did enjoy the grapling hook.
I got to the point where you exit the ship to an open area and realized that I don't want to play it any more. I uninstalled it.

Then, I started thinking about what other FPS game I could play and I remembered Titanfall 2.
This is one of those FPS games that just blew my expectations. I first played it on PS4 and loved it. That was few years ago.

I bought it on Steam as it was on sale and played it again.
Man, this game rocks. I love the movement, the gunplay, the setting, the atmosphere, the story, pacing, characters. Graphics and art style are amazing as well.

79372,6,Tue,Apr,2021,14:05:00,Outriders,"Judging this game by the core game mechanics and gameplay alone, this is quite possibly the best looter shooter I've ever played. This is coming from someone who has put in well over 1,000 hours into Destiny (1&2 combined) and many hours combined from Division and Doom. This game checks all the boxes for a strong power fantasy while giving you the customization to truly play the game how you want to play it by way of the crafting system. Even a build that isn't necessarily defined as ""meta"" can shine by how powerful the crafting can make it.

The only gripes I have with the core gameplay is the movement can sometimes feel janky, although I've found running it with DX11 fixes most of that. And with monsters getting this kind of interrupt resistance when they've taken too much interrupt damage, it isn't reciprocated to you so sometimes you're put in a bad spot when you're the last one alive in your squad and you're trying to rez a teammate but you keep getting knocked out of the animation.

Do you enjoy endless grinding for loot that has abysmal drop rates? do you enjoy playing russian roulette with your abilities? Not knowing whether they will work fine, or glitch your character into being umplayable? Do you enjoy a relatively cool story that culminates in mindless, timed DPS races? Do you enjoy not knowing if this login will be the one that wipes your entire inventory? Do you enjoy playing a game that is supposed to be played with friends, but then not being able to play with them due to terrible server issues?

It takes a while to get your eye in and get good at the game, and I certainly don't spend as much time learning all the weapon mods as some - though Google is your friend for certain encounters. 

I play solo about half the time, and in a fireteam the other half, and it is a load of fun.

Graphically it's one of the best looking games out there. The story has been great in the past, though if I'm honest Witch Queen wasn't as good as the Red War. I'm hopeful for the new expansion coming up though, and Bungie chuck in tons of seasonal content to give you things to aim at.

One area I don't play is PVP. Others love it, but for me it's just giving YouTube kiddies a grownup to kill over and over again and that's no fun. :-) 

You also need to join a guild to get teams of 6 for the raids. I've not done too much of that, as you just need more time than I tend to have.

Think Diablo 3 with guns and way more fun game play and that's pretty much endgame. Run expeditions (Rifts) on different tiers to get better loot and create specialized builds to your play style. 

Critique would be that it seems the game play balancing team is basing their decisions off of data instead of how people actually feel about the classes. While it does work it makes them seem out of touch of the player base's needs as they generally don't go hand in hand with ""number data"" balancing. I hope they can change this in the future but the game is still new so we'll see.

TLDR: A game with a bad ass MC that has game play that makes you feel equally bad ass with a bunch of connection issues.

78954,7,Wed,Apr,2021,00:21:34,Outriders,"TLDR: Save yourself some money and stay away from this dumpster fire. Some things can be patched, this game is deeply flawed by design.

Let's start with the most obvious technical issues:
Outriders is a multiplayer game with dysfunctional multiplayer feature. I'm not talking servers being overloaded on launch, which CAN be fixed (eventually lol). It's more about finding a random group is nearly impossible and when the matchmaking actually works and you get connected to somebody, 90% of the time it's somebody from the other side of the world, so the rubberbanding and desync makes it completely unplayable. Other than that, you usually connect to someone that wants to play solo and just forgot to set their game to ""friends only"" or ""closed"". So they kick you out as soon as they can. Now, this would be fine if you went back to lobby or something. In Outriders, when you get kicked, the game exits to desktop. 
Now, let's say that by some kind of miracle after hours of searching you manage to find a random that communicates and wants to play together. Then you can enjoy maybe 5 minutes of laggy mess, until the game crashes to desktop. Good luck trying to find that person again, cause there is no ""recently played"" list.

So, if you don't have friends that own the game and are willing to suffer through constant disconnects, the only thing left is to play solo. Forget about any kind synergies from multiple classes. You know, the main thing a co-op game with multiple classes is built around. Want to play a long-range support character? Enjoy being bum-rushed by hordes of melee opponents, or bulletspongy bosses that teleport directly on top of you. Or dropping gear with multiplayer only mods.
Sure the game is playable solo, if you follow one of the few and extremely broken builds.

Other than that, the game poses as a third-person ""cover shooter"". There's cover literally everywhere, but the game punishes you hard for taking it. The only way to play the game is to rush enemies head on (or they rush you). There are 4 classes, but they all have the same and only viable, hectic and ironically boring  playstyle.

So far, this overpriced dumpster fire reminds me of Diablo 3 launch, only much worse. Speaking of D3, remember how you could drop barbarian only gear with intelligence on it? Yeah, in Outriders you can look forward to same nonsensical bullshit. ""Long range damage"" modifiers on a shotgun, ""close range damage"" on a bolt-action sniper rifle, etc.
So, when you finally drop your first legendary after hours of grinding (yes, it's that bad), it may very well be completely useless.

VERY IMPORTANT POINT:
The demo / beginning of solo campaign is actually kinda enjoyable. The horrible aspects of the game become apparent just a couple hours in, so you can't refund anymore. Almost feels like it was done on purpose. Demo is supposed to give you an idea what the rest of the game is like. Sadly, that's not the case for Outriders.

Honestly, the best part of this game is a mediocre story, with poor writing, that leaves you with more questions than it answers.

and when the matchmaking actually works and you get connected to somebody ninety percent of the time it s somebody from the other side of the world so the rubberbanding and desync makes it completely unplayable other than that you usually connect to someone that wants to play solo and just forgot to set their game to friends only or closed so they kick you out as soon as they can now this would be fine if you went back to lobby or something in outriders when you get kicked the game exits to desktop now let s say that by some kind of miracle after hours of searching you manage to find a random that communicates and wants to play together then you can enjoy maybe five minutes of laggy mess until the game crashes to desktop good luck trying to find that person again cause there is no recently played list so if you don t have friends that own the game and are willing to suffer through constant disconnects the only thing left is to play solo forget about any kind synergies from multiple classes you know the main thing a co op game with multiple classes is built around want to play a long range support character enjoy being bum rushed by hordes of melee opponents or bulletspongy bosses that teleport directly on top of you or dropping gear with multiplayer only mods sure the game is playable solo if you follow one of the few and extremely broken builds other than that the game poses as a third person cover shooter there s cover literally everywhere but the game punishes you hard for taking it the only way to play the game is to rush enemies head on or they rush you there are four classes but they all have the same and only viable hectic and ironically boring playstyle so far this overpriced dumpster fire reminds me of diablo three launch only much worse speaking of dthree remember how you could drop barbarian only gear with intelligence on it yeah in outriders you can look forward to same nonsensical bullshit long range damage modifiers on a shotgun close range damage on a bolt action sniper rifle etc so when you finally drop your first legendary after hours of grinding yes it s that bad it may very well be completely useless very important point the demo beginning of solo campaign is actually kinda enjoyable the horrible aspects of the game become apparent just a couple hours in so you can t refund anymore almost feels like it was done on purpose demo is supposed to give you an idea what the rest of the game is like sadly that s not the case for outriders honestly the best part of this game is a mediocre story with poor writing that leaves you with more questions than it answers,tldr save stay dumpster fire things patched game deeply flawed design start obvious technical issues outriders multiplayer game dysfunctional multiplayer feature talking

110673,28,Sun,Nov,2021,08:30:24,Destiny 2,"Been playing since forsaken and have loved the gameplay ever since the go faster update. But the recent string of moving content to the Content vault (effectively deleting content) is has just gotten to be too much for me.

Long story short, forsaken saved this game. You delete forsaken I delete your game.

Please start respecting your own content. Stop making me look at content I pay for, and think ""what's its expiration date?""

I would like to see Bungie take this game in a different direction similar to other MMOs where you can play all the content from the game's history.

It is crazy to me to think that I can do basic math on ""expansions"" to the game and determine that at best we are getting an even trade of old content being effectively deleted for the new.

I know Bungie has their technical reasons for doing this, and that it is legal as part of the TOS. 

But I will say this, I feel bad buying this style of content. Literally no other game I know of does this, and it drastically impacts the value proposition in my eyes.

If they change their philosophy on content I will change my view on the value proposition but these days I cannot recommend this game. Hopefully they can turn it around and I'll see you all star side. Until then, may your god rolls be plentiful guardians!

75606,10,Sat,Apr,2021,07:58:33,Outriders,"Compared to even early Warframe, this game is a mess and not worth the $60.  Netplay is buggy as hell, where i've respawned ""dead"", unable to move or have a character model, but could use my instant-cast abilities.  Enemies come in waves with little to no warning and no directional clues, sound design in general is god awful.  Melee enemies can stunlock you into death so there's no way to really do high levels (known as world levels) without the item levels.  Unless you want to, and are in an area where you can, cheese the poor enemy AI.  You can leash bosses to cleared areas and few of their mooks will follow, for example.

The story is lifted straight from D-list action movies with a protagnoist who can't decide whether he's the carefree, callous asshole or everybody's errand boy.  ""Twists"" get brought up and organic moments for characters to discuss said ""twists"" are inexplicably shelved until 5 missions later.  People die like flies, but we're never given a reason to care. In other words, it's fine for a looter-shooter.

Didn't get far enough to be able to talk about gear, but shooting element felt moderately polished.  Abilities as the pyromancer felt fine, a hard limit on 3 felt constraining but in-line with the genre.

73098,14,Wed,Apr,2021,00:49:35,Outriders,"First off, if you like a game to be completely finished with no issues before giving it a go, then go look for another game. Its been a consistent trend for the last 5+ years for AAA companies to release games unfinished and this one is no exception. 

With that being said, if little things here and there dont bug you as long as the core gameplay experience is working correctly, then read on. 

This is not a live service game like Destiny 2, and as such I wont be comparing it to games like that. If I had to compare it to anything its got the gameplay experience of Borderlands with the rain of loot like Diablo. 

You've got your guns and your abilities. Your abilities arnt just there to supplement your gunplay like in Borderlands, they ARE your gameplay, just like Diablo. Anomaly (magic) builds will be spamming them off cooldown while more weapon-centric builds will still be using them fairly often. You cant win on just gameplay alone in other words. 

At launch there are 4 classes to play (In order from easiest to play to hardest): 
â¢ Technomancer
â¢ Devastator
â¢ Pyromancer
â¢ Trickster

Techno and Devastator are considered to be good solo classes while pyro and trick take a bit more setup. 

Overall the game has its faults, just like any other game from the last few years, but if you can get past those small issues and you enjoy the core gameplay loop that Borderlands and Diablo 3 gave rolled into a looter-shooter then you'll likely enjoy this game. 

For a much more detailed ""review"" of the game I'd recommend checking out Datto's recent video ""Is Outriders worth $60?"":

42179,28,Wed,Dec,2022,22:49:14,Fallout 76,"It's... Fallout.  Not great, not terrible, but fans of the series will find it familiar enough.

Personally, I feel like making this an MMO was a poor decision - the story really suffers for it, as in, there's hardly any.  One of the strong points of the Fallout games is the detailed stories with Wasteland-altering consequences, but because MMOs are by nature static there's not a whole lot of room for storytelling.  There are a couple of factions, each with a main quest line and a bunch of sidequests, but in the end they mostly just exist for handing out daily quests.  And of course, the biggest weakness of MMOs: no pausing. Not in the Pip-Boy, not in VATS, not in conversations, not when you've gotta go take a leak and put your kid to bed... better find a safe place to park if you need to step away for a few minutes.  At least you don't die if your hunger/thirst meters run out.

As with all MMOs, it eventually boils down to grinding dailies and cosmetics.  In this case the cosmetics are your CAMP, which pulls a lot of the settlement-building mechanics from Fallout 4.  And I have to say, after wandering Appalachia for quite a while, there are some very creative Dwellers out there when it comes to building a CAMP site.  So if that's your thing, you'll probably have a lot of fun with this.

Then there's the Fallout 1st thing.  Your stash is limited (you'd be surprised how quickly you can amass 1200 lbs of stuff), but hey, just pay $13/mo for unlimited storage and a few other perks. :eyeroll:  Might be worth it if you really get into the game and want to make the most of your CAMP, but for someone like me who's just going to play for a while and then move on it feels like a total scam.  I could buy a whole new game for $13.

A quick word about the community - they're mostly friendly, at least the folks I met.  Despite the fact that PvP is always on (turning on ""peaceful"" mode just means you take less damage when you get shot), people don't generally go around murdering each other.  I got killed one time because I was in the way when some guy was trying to claim a workshop (I'm assuming, because there's no in-game chat), but he was at least nice enough to not take my stuff or shoot me again when I came back to get it.  Another guy I encountered just gave me a bunch of stuff, upgrading one of my guns with some nice mods and giving me a super-jump serum.

I also thought that the leveling system was interesting.  As with Fallout 4, you get a new stat point and perk with each level. But in this game the perks come as cards, and each SPECIAL stat has as many slots as you have points in the stat.  So a min-maxer could presumably swap out perks based on the situation, like using the lockpick perks only when you're actually picking a lock, or using the building perks when you're building your CAMP.  Or you could be lazy like me and just run with a general loadout.  What I didn't like is that enemies are always level-scaled, but weapons don't scale, so you're always having to pick up new weapons to keep up, which kinda decreases the value of legendaries and modding.

I also enjoyed the variety of environments.  Previous Fallout games tended to lean heavily on the Real Is Brown aesthetic, but this one has a lot more color.  You start out in a beautiful mountain forest, and can travel to the sickly toxic lake, the gray ash waste, the bright red cranberry bog, and so on.

In summary, they mixed Fallout with an MMO and got something that's not quite either.  But it's still a passable entry for die-hard Fallout fans.",it s fallout not great not terrible but fans of the series will find it familiar enough personally i feel like making this an mmo was a poor decision the story really suffers for it as in there s hardly any one of the strong points of the fallout games is the detailed stories with wasteland altering consequences but because mmos are by nature static there s not a whole lot of room for storytelling there are a couple of factions each with a main quest line and a bunch of sidequests but in the end they mostly just exist for handing out daily quests and of course the biggest weakness of mmos no pausing not in the pip boy not in vats not in conversations not when you ve gotta go take a leak and put your kid to bed better find a safe place to park if you need to step away for a few minutes at least you don t die if your hunger thirst meters run out as with all mmos it eventually boils down to grinding dailies and cosmetics in this case the cosmetics are your camp which pulls a lot of the settlement building mechanics from fallout four and i have to say after wandering appalachia for quite a while there are some very creative dwellers out there when it comes to building a camp site so if that s your thing you ll probably have a lot of fun with this then there s the fallout 1st thing your stash is limited you d be surprised how quickly you can amass one thousand two hundred lbs of stuff but hey just pay dollar thirteen mo for unlimited storage and a few other perks eyeroll might be worth it if you really get into the game and want to make the most of your camp but for someone like me who s just going to play for a while and then move on it feels like a total scam i could buy a whole new game for dollar thirteen a quick word about the community they re mostly friendly at least the folks i met despite the fact that pvp is always on turning on peaceful mode just means you take less damage when you get shot people don t generally go around murdering each other i got killed one time because i was in the way when some guy was trying to claim a workshop i m assuming because there s no in game chat but he was at least nice enough to not take my stuff or shoot me again when i came back to get it another guy i encountered just gave me a bunch of stuff upgrading one of my guns with some nice mods and giving me a super jump serum i also thought that the leveling system was interesting as with fallout four you get a new stat point and perk with each level but in this game the perks come as cards and each special stat has as many slots as you have points in the stat so a min maxer could presumably swap out perks based on the situation like using the lockpick perks only when you re actually picking a lock or using the building perks when you re building your camp or you could be lazy like me and just run with a general loadout what i didn t like is that enemies are always level scaled but weapons don t scale so you re always having to pick up new weapons to keep up which kinda decreases the value of legendaries and modding i also enjoyed the variety of environments previous fallout games tended to lean heavily on the real is brown aesthetic but this one has a lot more color you start out in a beautiful mountain forest and can travel to the sickly toxic lake the gray ash waste the bright red cranberry bog and so on in summary they mixed fallout with an mmo and got something that s not quite either but it s still a passable entry for die hard fallout fans,fallout great

17913,12,Fri,Mar,2021,04:00:17,Borderlands 3,"First the good points: great game, lots of fun, really captures the essence of the franchise. The new customization vehicles was a really nice touch, which was an issue in previous Borderlands since some vehicle weapons became kind of useless on harder difficulty levels. The adjustable Madness Levels after completing the base storyline content was another great feature, it really makes replay an extremely worthwhile experience. With Madness settings, you not only increase the difficulty of the game but the loot drops improve considerably. I set the Madness level to 11, and it took me almost 10 minutes to kill a single scag with my best weapon. Also, the addition of female psychos and raiders as enemies was a nice touch, though it seems a little unbalanced because the common enemy NPCs seem to be disproportionately female, like more than 60% of the time I'm shooting female psychos. I feel like that is by design, like there were a lot of complaints that there weren't any female enemy NPCs, so they decided to make it overwhelmingly obvious by making random encounters more likely to be female. I'm not sure what kind of idiot thought making violence against women more common makes a more inclusive, less sexist game, but I guess be careful what you ask for from a game developer. 
The drawbacks:  the game has issues that cause problems with certain video cards, most notably the fact that most people cannot actually play the game without it crashing unless they set it on Direct X 11 instead of 12. Without a fairly new video card, your system is really going to be struggling to keep the game functioning if it doesn't start crashing randomly. The other major drawback is the absolutely insane amount of money the DLC costs (a whopping $140 for all non-cosmetic DLC). With Borderlands and Borderlands 2, I never felt pressured in the game to buy DLC.  In Borderlands 3, you get a lot of annoying promps to access DLC content that you don't even possess. I felt that is a little unnecessary since most people will inevitably buy the DLC after growing bored with replaying the base content multiple times. Moreover, when the DLC costs more than the base game, it seems pretty clear that the developers are trying to gouge its customer base. 
Overall, it's a great game, I'd recommend it, though I would wait until the price drops on that DLC when it becomes a little more affordable. And if you are a weird sicko who likes shooting crazy, psychotic women in the head, you will not be disappointed by Borderlands 3.",first the good points great game lots of fun really captures the

14981,27,Sun,Jun,2021,19:46:57,Borderlands 3,"In terms of game mechanics, the game has improved from Borderlands 2 by a lot: item banks, mantling, more interesting guns and their unique traits for different manufacturers. The four new vault hunters are also a lot of fun to play with, each with three action skills for you to choose. Fast travel is more convenient. I really enjoy playing Borderlands 3.

However, the game's story is kind of meh. Some may think it's okay, but as a person who has played Borderlands 2 before, I have to say that Borderlands 3's story is far from comparable with Borderlands 2's. The DLCs' stories aren't also any better. This makes the game a bit boring after a few replays.

End-game content is kind of interesting. The takedown missions, trials, and circles of slaughter are very challenging. Although I don't love the new Mayhem 2.0 system because of some annoying modifiers, the addition of Mayhem 11 (max difficulty with no modifiers) keeps the end-game experience interesting. There is an exception though. In mayhem levels, the legendary items drop way too often, making them less valuable, and it would feel less exciting when a legendary gun drops.

Overall, I had a lot of fun playing this game. The story however is not very good. If you are serious about the story, I would not recommend you buying this game.

46965,6,Sun,Feb,2022,02:44:21,Fallout 76,"i love bethesda their attention to detail with quests in skyrim are the only reasons i wanted to get into fallout. This was not a good introduction it is a crappy destiny in fallout universe laggy mess. It has less than 60 fps no real tutorial it feels like a free game i paid 40 bucks for i feel ripped off by reviewers who said it was great after the wastelanders update they are super wrong, there is nothing great about it. the only thing that sucks is the open world is really cool because West Virginia is a great setting but doesn't save this train wreck that bethesda clearly knew better than to make. It is not world of warcraft it's not destiny and according to most people the only thing that remotely makes this fallout is power armor. Oh and starfield has 1000 planets cause todd howard couldn't overpromise enough with 1 planet, bethesda is clearly dying they wont be able to compete in future years and this game was the beginning of a flaming trainwreck. This set in motion a series of horrible events (remember deathloop?) that wont change THIS GAME RUINED THEM. Keep in mind they made skyrim and fallout 4 on variations of this engine did they not stop and think maybe that wouldnt work for an mmo. This is so sad for me they didnt have to do anything all they had to do was make it playable modders can and have done this better MODDERS you know the people who arent gifted multi million dollar budgets. This is a crap game made by devs that either are sellouts who no longer care or they didnt have a choice either way. I dont know if ill buy another one of their games unless they somehow make up for this i doubt it, just play skyrim youll save your money and it is an actually good game.

79162,6,Tue,Apr,2021,19:48:17,Outriders,"So far so good. I have around 6 hours in the demo and a few in the full game which I decided to pick up today. 

At first I was slightly concerned because of the mixed reviews but as I looked into I noticed it was mainly being bombed due to server  issues at launch and a massive amount of cying for not being able to play offline.. Launch issues are very common for massive releases even for well established developers the fact that this is humans can flys first release it's actually very impressive its not going worse. Anyway it's not something that is going to make a difference for me personally  I can wait a few days until things get ironed out if need be I just want the actual game mechanics to be good.  I figured I would give them a review based on the actual game considering the tantrum kids have kinda skewed reviews for this game.

All that said I am  not a huge looter shooter guy but the way the combat feels in outriders, and the mixture of RPG elements, fast paced combat, enjoyable  side and main story quests, many tiers of difficulty with % increased loot chance for higher mode, makes this game a huge win for me so far. Here are a few reasons why I am really liking Outriders so far and think I will continue to.


1 .The loot is not overbearing. Games like Boarderlands throw so many guns at you that you get desensitized to them really quick and getting weapons is not very exciting and can even be annoying after awhile. The pacing in Outriders is much nicer with guns dropping much less frequently than a game like boarder lands and other looters instead of exploding out of ever pixel imaginable.

2. Combat is fast paced and exciting. The game really pushes an aggressive  playstyle which you will need to employ to stay alive giving you leech effects for a short period after you use your abilities to heal and soak damage. The abilities (so far I can only speak for trickster) are a absolute blast to use and make you feel like a freaking badass!

3. Gear... Outriders has upgrades not just in the form of guns but also armor as well. The loot in outriders can have perks that buff your abilities or give you passive bonus's to stats and or active abilities giving you more flexibility to experiment with different builds. So far the loot in outriders is looking very nice.

4. Skill tree. I am really liking the skill tree it offers a good deal of customization without being overbearing.

So far I have had one bug.. It is a UI glitch where your hud vanishes and you need to relog. Other than that I was stable for the time I have played today and have not lagged or crashed. Bottom line is if you liked the DEMO you are gonna like the game. If you are not somebody that life is going to be ruined if a game suffers a few bugs or server issues in the first week or two of release and it causes you to resort to trash talking developers and acting like a child I think you should give this a pass. However if you are really feeling the demo and you don't have the sensibility of an entitled 12 year old brat (varuka salt) Than give it a go!",so far so good i have around six hours in the demo and a

1/2 cup white sugar

1/4 cup water

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

1 pinch salt

5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced

1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.

Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.

Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

76915,9,Fri,Apr,2021,02:30:39,Outriders,"Ok so I have almost 60 hours of playtime since release on the PC and as much as I like the game, there are too many negatives for me to recommend it.

PRO's:

Really nice crafting system and levelling system for guns.  Very well done.
Good farming system for improving gear through buying or crafting.
Most skills are fun and have a place in rotation.
Gun types have enough differences to make them viable.
Combat is fast paced and fun, health recovery is done well.
I liked the story.  It made me always wanting to learn more.
End game is decent.

NEG:

Upcoming nerf's are not warranted yet.  This is not competetive.
No crossplay mentioned in patch and was the main reason I bought the game.
Online only even for solo play?  They need to rethink this idea.
End game rewards based on how fast you finish is unfair to slower builds.
Still buggy but I have not had many issues.
Still getting server disconnects but not nearly as much.


The game reminds me a lot of Mass Effect and how it plays.

The main reason I am giving a thumbs down is because my wife plays on Xbox and I play on the PC.  Xbox gets it for free with game pass which is nice, so I figured I would dole out the $60 for the PC.  Come to find out that as much as crossplay was pushed, it doesn't work.  You can connect but you just lose connection right away.  This should be a huge priority but they haven't mentioned anything about a timeline.  I understand it will be rough with different platforms having different rules on patches, but they need to make this work.

Also, I like the end game but I enjoy playing sniper builds as well as the in-your-face builds, but the end game punishes you for going slow.  Not sure why they would reward only 1 style of players and punish another.  I can still finish the WT with my sniper, but I get fewer rewards because I didn't get it done fast like my Trickster might.  The difference in rewards is significant.

If they get the crossplay fixed even remotely soon and rethink nerfing classes like they are and rethink how they dole out rewards, I would be happy to change to a thumbs up!!",ok so i have almost sixty hours of playtime since release on the pc and as much as i like the game there are too many negatives for me to recommend it pro s really nice crafting system and levelling system for guns very well done good farming system for improving gear through buying or crafting most skills are fun and have a place in rotation gun types have enough differences to make them viable combat is fast paced and fun health recovery is done well i liked the story it made me always wanting to learn more end game is decent neg upcoming nerf s are not warranted yet this is not competetive no crossplay mentioned in patch and was the main reason i bought the game online only even for solo play they need to rethink this idea end game rewards based on how fast you finish is unfair to slower builds still buggy but i have not had many issues still getting server disconnects but not nearly as much the game reminds me a lot of mass effect and how it plays the main reason i am giving a thumbs down is because my wife plays on xbox and i play on the pc xbox gets it for free with game pass which is nice so i figured i would dole out the dollar sixty for the pc come to find out that as much as crossplay was pushed it doesn t work you can connect but you just lose connection right away this should be a huge priority but they haven t mentioned anything about a timeline i understand it will be rough with different platforms having different rules on patches but they need to make this work also i like the end game but i enjoy playing sniper builds as well as the in your face builds but the end game punishes you for going slow not sure why they would reward only one style of players and punish another i can still finish the wt with my sniper but i get fewer rewards because i didn t get it done fast like my trickster might the difference in rewards is significant if they get the crossplay fixed even remotely soon and rethink nerfing classes like they are and rethink how they dole out rewards i would be happy to change to a thumbs up,hours playtime release pc game negatives recommend pro nice crafting system levelling system guns farming system improving gear buying crafting skills fun rotation gun types differences make viable combat paced fun health recovery made wanting learn end game decent neg upcoming nerf warranted competetive crossplay mentioned reason bought game online solo play rethink idea end game rewards based finish unfair slower builds buggy issues server disconnects game reminds lot mass effect plays reason giving thumbs wife plays xbox play pc xbox game nice figured dole pc find crossplay pushed work connect lose connection huge priority mentioned timeline understand rough platforms rules patches make work end game enjoy playing sniper builds face builds end game punishes slow reward style players punish finish wt sniper fewer rewards trickster difference rewards significant crossplay fixed remotely rethink nerfing classes rethink dole rewards happy change thumbs,hours playtime release pc game negatives recommend pro nice crafting system levelling system guns farming system improving gear buying crafting skills fun rotation gun types differences make viable combat paced fun health recovery made wanting learn end game decent neg upcoming nerf warranted competetive crossplay mentioned reason bought game online solo play rethink idea end game rewards based finish unfair slower builds buggy issues server disconnects game reminds lot mass effect plays reason giving thumbs wife plays xbox play pc xbox game nice figured dole pc find crossplay pushed work connect lose connection huge priority mentioned timeline understand rough platforms rules patches make work end game enjoy playing sniper builds face builds end game punishes slow reward style players punish finish wt sniper fewer rewards trickster difference rewards significant crossplay fixed remotely rethink nerfing classes rethink dole rewards happy change thumbs,0,0,0.0

Good
- You can play with your friends, which is the real selling point here
- Other players are generally a pretty chill crowd, I think I've had PVP fights averaging once in 125 hours of game time (assuming you're not going into the Nuclear Winter mode)
- The Enclave uniform is one of my favourite pieces of clothing in all of Fallout
- I currently have a pet Deathclaw at my C.A.M.P.

Bad
- There is story and more has been added with later updates, but eventually you find yourself looking at other Fallout games in order to get lost in stories
- It's still a Bethesda game so you'll be running into bugs, but so far from my experience they're minor and I was able to work around them to complete things OR they were addressed in an update and fixed

Ugly
- So very grindy 
- Buy the things with caps, scrip, gold, atoms... I feel like I'm missing a currency because there are just so many of them

To answer this thesis, you need to look at the history of Bethesda games. At the start, all of the studio's games were hated by the community. Skyrim was terribly buggy, but eventually became a legend game. Fallout 4 is just Fallout 4, you know everything yourself. But with release of Fallout 76, we're looking at F4 as a good game. Maybe the secret of Bethesda games is to make games worse than the past:)

What can I say about Fallout 76, after the release on steam, a huge number of bugs were removed in the game, but the game is still buggy. Do they seriously interfere with the game? I can say no. The game has a lot of positive facts that completely overlap the disadvantages of the game. The game has just a great community, you will always be helped by supplies, company and many other things with which people help each other in everyday life.

Once on a raid I turned on the music and people began to sing along. At that moment, I realized what attracted this game. Regardless of our races, gender, political views, we can just be human. In the end, I can say that Fallout 76 is a good game, perhaps the weakest in the series, but not bad from that.

75461,10,Sat,Apr,2021,10:42:33,Outriders,"I should say up front that I play the game single player so my experience is based on that. I hear there are a lot of issues around multiplayer/coop. I may check that out some day, but the game is fun in single player and it doesn't force you to do coop if you don't want to.

Hmm... Where to begin? I think this game is pretty cool. I guess, somehow, it's not amazing (for some reason people keep saying this game is mediocre) but I don't really know if I agree. The shooting feels really good, the strategy they developed for healing is awesome, combat feels smart, changes up, and feels like you have plenty of options.
I hear complaints about the cover system. That it's ""meaningless"" and possibly ""only for the NPCs."" I have not experienced this. Maybe it's class dependent, I don't know. I play the pyromancer class with an assault rifle and a sniper rifle (i was going to do shotgun, but the skill tree seems to rely on these two so I switched to focusing on sniper rifle in my off instead). I use cover when it's necessary and pick off enemies from cover a lot (oh and I'm still playing at my highest world level- currently at 5). Sure, I can't *always* do this, but as I said previously combat changes up. Every encounter feels like you have to strategize. There are a lot of enemies that storm your position, true, but if you strategize the encounters it doesn't effect whether or not cover is viable. at least it hasn't been that way for me. So, with what I'm currently playing, cover feels viable as much as run and gunning can. It just depends on the situation and I feel that was intentional.
I hear people say that the writing in this is bad. People can fly have never been master story tellers, true. But the writing has been unoffensive to me thus far, and I am known to be pretty aggressivle critical of writing in film and video games that rely on it. Sure, it's all over the place (sometimes the character you play is really nice and other times he is just randomly a super asshole with no clear reason- just for one example) but I have not found it to be so bad that it affects my enjoyment of the game. The game so far isn't really focused on storytelling. It's just a means to an end and I think it's used well. I don't always read the journals, and really you don't have to. I listen to them talk when I want and if I don't like it I just move the game a long. So far I have not felt the need to rush the dialogue. It's not amazing, but it's been unoffensive (even with the PCF patented incorrect usage of curse words it's been seemingly toned down from the usual fare so far).
The acting is bad. If you want you can get to a point, like me, where you can ignore it because the combat mechanics are really really good, but I would liken the acting in this game to when wrestlers make movies under the WWE banner. It's really bad, but completely fine in context and kind of fun anyway.
There are a lot of bugs, but for me this has not been a problem. I may have gotten lucky but I have had no crashes (oh god, maybe I will now that I said that :(  ) and no major problems. There is weird screen tearing on some cut scenes, and hitchy behavior of animations in cut scenes, but in game play it's been completely fine. I can even run the game at max setting on my, what I would consider a, mid tier computer. It looks great and only really has weird graphical issues on cut scenes. Everywhere else it's been totally fine. This is not to say I don't believe people having issues. I feel for them and I hope that gets fixed. For me there has been no major technical issues so far. Maybe PCF has been fixing the game quickly (I've only started playing yesterday).
Speaking of graphics another complaint I have seen is that people think this game is uglyu. Mostly browns and grays. Again this is contextual. You have seen videos or maybe played the demo of a small portion of the game. There is more to the terrain than this. True the story calls for some post apocalyptic type destruction of a world, but they find ways to still vary it up and I honestly think they did a good job of finding ways to keep you from only seeing brown and gray. There are some cool settings and I think people should give it a little more of a chance. This is no ""Prototype"" (the video game). There's a variety here- at least so far of what I have seen (It is true- I have only played 8 hours).
I feel people were very quick to judge this game harshly. I understand that they unfortunately were published under Square Enix (who, as far as I know does not own PCF so let's all calm down) and that holds a lot of bad feelings ever since Avengers. But let's be reasonable. PCF seem to be fixing the game very quickly and that is commendable. They also have developed an incredibly fun loot driven shooter that so far does not appear to be forcing me to get loot boxes and you feel very powerful in combat while not necessarily always feeling over powered (this is my experience). I know there will be nerfs apparently- I don't know how this will affect the game. We'll have to see. Right now it's pretty awesome.
I really do hope this game continues to be like it is right now. It's a blast to play, minus some grievances I have with certain enemies being a pain in my ass, and if it does I will probably play all the different classes. I am enjoying it that much.",i should say up front that i play the game single player so my experience is based on that i hear there are a lot of issues around multiplayer coop i may check that out some day but the game is fun in single player and it doesn t force you to do coop if you don t want to hmm where to begin i think this game is pretty cool i guess somehow it s not amazing for some reason people keep saying this game is mediocre but i don t really know if i agree the shooting feels really good the strategy they developed for healing is awesome combat feels smart changes up and feels like you have plenty of options i hear complaints about the cover system that it s meaningless and possibly only for the npcs i have not experienced this maybe it s class dependent i don t know i play the pyromancer class with an assault rifle and a sniper rifle i was going to do shotgun but the skill tree seems to rely on these two so i switched to focusing on sniper rifle in my off instead i use cover when it s necessary and pick off enemies from cover a lot oh and i m still playing at my highest world level currently at five sure i can t always do this but as i said previously combat changes up every encounter feels like you have to strategize there are a lot of enemies that storm your position true but if you strategize the encounters it doesn t effect whether or not cover is viable at least it hasn t been that way for me so with what i m currently playing cover feels viable as much as run and gunning can it just depends on the situation and i feel that was intentional i hear people say that the writing in this is bad people can fly have never been master story tellers true but the writing has been unoffensive to me thus far and i am known to be pretty aggressivle

2260,22,Wed,Feb,2023,07:53:10,Borderlands 3,"The game attempts to satyrize influencer culture and late capitalism without actually saying anything about them. The humor of the game is essentially ""look how annoying this character is! Haha so annoying!"" and ""haha nihilism!"" The same boring fetch quests that I was tired of fifteen years ago. Gameplay is ""follow map marker, hold down left mouse button when you encounter enemies"". On the rare occasion that the game contains any kind of puzzle, there is a voiceover that tells you exactly how to solve it before you can really even think about it.  I remember Borderlands 1, where the gameplay felt chaotic and nail-biting. Back then, the gameplay matched the aesthetic tone of world. I felt like life was cheap.

Reminded me of playing Diablo 3 because you basically just run around shooting and spamming your abilities as fast as possible. Gameplay is ok but there are so many QoL things in the game that is feels super unpolished. The map is terrible you cant even see yourself on it other than showing you what banner youre closest to. That doesnt help when im trying find a certain quest start or something. And the layout of everything is so weird. I hate that you have to travel between so many camps depending on what you need to do. The way you move from one area to the next feels like 2 generations ago. Literally just Hold X to enter ""quest zone"" and then some half assed cut-scene of you jumping this or riding that.  And then theres the dialogue. Some of the worst dialogue and voice acting Ive ever heard in a game. Some of the lines are so corny that I legit snorted laughing. The thing is it gets old really quick so I just ended up skipping about 55% of all the story scenes. So i've beat the game but i have no idea what was actually happening. It didnt feel cinematic at all like Destiny's cutscenes are. Then there's mulitplayer. The connection is total garbage. Even if Im the host it lags sooooo bad. Sometimes the game will lock up for over 10 seconds and I come back to being dead. The connection is terrible in general. Ive never had a game that refused to let me past the title screen like this one does.

64137,21,Sun,Nov,2021,09:56:52,Outriders,"Erased and restarted this review several times trying to figure out how to get my frustrations across in a meaningful and articulate manner without coming across as a pissed off entitled asshole but I'm finding that very difficult to do.

The Pros:
1. The story was great. It really drew me in and the twists really got me a couple of times. 9/10 would play the story again.
2. The gear, mods, affixes, and general progression of the game really seems fun...if you can play it. (more on that below)
3. The graphics are pretty awesome as well as the particle effects on the skills are awesome.
4. The gun play really feels like it has some impact which is satisfying.
5. After the New Horizon update, drops seem to be more prevalent which is a nice change. I've been getting some interesting drops since the update and that's always fun a in a game built around loot.

The Cons:
1. Multiplayer is trash. The peer-to-peer system needs to go and be routed through hosted servers (although those can be pretty trash as well). I bought this game to play with friends but we can't do so because whoever isn't the host lags the fuck out on a constant basis and generally becomes dead weight to the host.
2. Playing solo isn't any fun. I don't know if it's because I just suck, or the game is intentionally trying to sandbag me, but I haven't been able to play above world tier 6 without getting my ass handed to me as a Pyromancer. I tend to do fairly well on certain fights, but if any of the mobs wind up being snipers, I might as well tuck my head between my legs and kiss my ass goodbye.
3. Always online single player. Who the fuck though this was a good idea? This is 2021, we should be going away from this shit by now but companies care more about DRM than the player experience. So now if I want to play I have to connect through some tin can and string connection to an Intel 386 server somewhere hosting thousands of people.

People can Fly and Squeenix have a potential hit on their hands. The core game play loop is fun and enjoyable but there are some major frustrations holding the game back from greatness and they need to work on those first before anything else in future patches. I really hope that I can come back to this review later and change to a recommend, but as of right now, with everything how it stands, I'd get it on sale if you really want to see the story or play it on Game Pass.",erased and restarted this review several times trying to figure out how to get my frustrations across in a meaningful and articulate manner without coming across as a pissed off entitled asshole but i m finding that very difficult to do the pros one the story was great it really drew me in and the twists really got me a couple of times nine one0 would play the story again two the gear mods affixes and general progression of the game really seems fun if you can play it more on that below three the graphics are pretty awesome as well as the particle effects on the skills are awesome four the gun play really feels like it has some impact which is satisfying five after the new horizon update drops seem to be more prevalent which is a nice change i ve been getting some interesting drops since the update and that s always fun a in a game built around loot the cons one multiplayer is trash the peer to peer system needs to go and be routed through hosted servers although those can be pretty trash as well i bought this game to play with friends but we can t do so because whoever isn t the host lags the fuck out on a constant basis and generally becomes dead weight to the host two playing solo isn t any fun i don t know if it s because i just suck or the game is intentionally trying to sandbag me but i haven t been able to play above world tier six without getting my ass handed to me as a pyromancer i tend to do fairly well on certain fights but if any of the mobs wind up being snipers i might as well tuck my head between my legs and kiss my ass goodbye three always online single player who the fuck though this was a good idea this is two0twoone we should be going away from this shit by now but companies care more about drm than the player experience so now if i want to play i have to connect through some tin can and string connection to an intel three8six server somewhere hosting thousands of people people can fly and squeenix have a potential hit on their hands the core game play loop is fun and enjoyable but there are some major frustrations holding the game back from greatness and they need to work on those first before anything else in future patches i really hope that i can come back to this review later and change to a recommend but as of right now with everything how it stands i d get it on sale if you really want to see the story or play it on game pass,erased restarted review times figure frustrations meaningful articulate manner coming pissed entitled asshole finding difficult pros great twists couple times one0 play gear mods affixes general progression game fun play graphics pretty awesome particle effects skills awesome gun play feels impact satisfying horizon update drops prevalent nice change interesting drops update fun game built loot cons multiplayer trash peer peer system routed hosted servers pretty trash bought game play friends host lags fuck basis generally dead weight host playing solo fun suck game intentionally sandbag play world tier ass handed pyromancer tend fairly fights mobs wind snipers legs kiss ass goodbye online single fuck idea two0twoone shit companies care drm experience play connect tin string connection intel three8six server hosting thousands people people fly squeenix potential hit hands game play loop fun enjoyable frustrations holding game greatness work future patches review change recommend stands play game,erased restarted review times figure frustrations meaningful articulate manner coming pissed entitled asshole finding difficult pros great twists couple times one0 play gear mods affixes general progression game fun play graphics pretty awesome particle effects skills awesome gun play feels impact satisfying horizon update drops prevalent nice change interesting drops update fun game built loot cons multiplayer trash peer peer system routed hosted servers pretty trash bought game play friends host lags fuck basis generally dead weight host playing solo fun suck game intentionally sandbag play world tier ass handed pyromancer tend fairly fights mobs wind snipers legs kiss ass goodbye online single fuck idea two0twoone shit companies care drm experience play connect tin string connection intel three8six server hosting thousands people people fly squeenix potential hit hands game play loop fun enjoyable frustrations holding game greatness work future patches review change recommend stands play game,0,10,0.624146879

In game it's very well polished and both pvp and pve are amazingly fun. But I can no longer support Bungie and their practices of removing paid content from the game. 
 
I paid for D2, Warmind, Curse of Osiris, Forsaken, Shadowkeep and Beyond Light. This is several hundred dollars in content and so far Bungie is removing or has removed over half of them. I can understand how Bungie want to keep the story and the narrative moving in a flowing evolving world. You don't have to delete half the game to achieve this.  Now the other excuse doesn't hold a lot of water. The games file size.  It's called optimizing they should really try it sometime.  That's why many other games specifically other MMOs haven't ballooned in size and they are able to keep day 1 content. Especially when we live in a time of expandable storage even for consoles file size begins to become less relevant.

So the gameplay is great no complains. But if you want to dish out money for content be ready to have it removed at some point.  Unfortunately they have already removed some great mission, strikes, map, and exotic quests. I would still be playing Destiny and a lot of it's missing content if they didn't keep hacking it away.",so i m going to start with saying i ve loved playing destiny two the gun play is top notch the graphics are good the game sounds great in game it s very well polished and both pvp and pve are amazingly fun but i can no longer support bungie and their practices of removing paid content from the game i paid for dtwo warmind curse of osiris forsaken shadowkeep and beyond light this is several hundred dollars in content and so far bungie is removing or has removed over half of them i can understand how bungie want to keep the story and the narrative moving in a flowing evolving world you don t have to delete half the game to achieve this now the other excuse doesn t hold a lot of water the games file size it s called optimizing they should really try it sometime that s why many other games specifically other mmos haven t ballooned in size and they are able to keep day one content especially when we live in a time of expandable storage even for consoles file size begins to become less relevant so the gameplay is great no complains but if you want to dish out money for content be ready to have it removed at some point unfortunately they have already removed some great mission strikes map and exotic quests i would still be playing destiny and a lot of it s missing content if they didn t keep hacking it away,start loved playing gun play top notch graphics game sounds great game polished pvp pve amazingly fun longer support bungie practices removing paid content game paid dtwo warmind curse osiris forsaken shadowkeep dollars content bungie removing removed half understand bungie narrative moving flowing evolving world delete half game achieve excuse hold lot water games file size called optimizing games specifically mmos ballooned size content live time expandable storage consoles file size begins relevant gameplay great complains dish content removed point removed great mission strikes map exotic quests playing lot missing content hacking,start loved playing gun play top notch graphics game sounds great game polished pvp pve amazingly fun longer support bungie practices removing paid content game paid dtwo warmind curse osiris forsaken shadowkeep dollars content bungie removing removed half understand bungie narrative moving flowing evolving world delete half game achieve excuse hold lot water games file size called optimizing games specifically mmos ballooned size content live time expandable storage consoles file size begins relevant gameplay great complains dish content removed point removed great mission strikes map exotic quests playing lot missing content hacking,0,6,0.553575814

78217,7,Wed,Apr,2021,17:48:34,Outriders,"Over 60 hours into this game so far....it fills my ""run and gun"" spot on the play list just fine.  The story is good.  The leveling/world tier progression is good, and familiar enough to Destiny/Warframe....that it is easy to adapt to.  There are alot of over critical cynics in the world doing reviews out of a sense of self importance, because they go into a game with expectations, usually derived from experiences in ANOTHER game....and you end up comparing it to aspects you liked from other games...I've played Destiny, Destiny 2, etc....and there are plenty of reviews about how this game compares to those...

So instead I will say -

This is a looter shooter, there are similarities across that genre.  Don't expect it to be the same as another looter shooter that you've played, let it be what it is, and judge it independently for its own rating.


The game:

It's fun!

You are on 1 planet, with specific types of life, and you do not venture very far in the grand scheme of the entire planet. As such, there isn't a huge variety to the wild life - outside of biome color shifts, and strength variants.  You do venture into several biomes, and the scenes can be pretty awesome....the landscapes look great, the game itself looks amazing.

There isn't the normal telegraphs for incoming damage that people have grown used to, they are there, but you have to pay attention instead of facerolling through like other looter shooters.

There are mechanics to fights, you have to learn them, and react to them....if you fail to do that, and try to just bull your way through, it will punish you.

The mods make the game, you have to work for your gear, and work for a specific build....so many ppl giving the game a bad review are very ignorantly just slapping whatever gear on and going, instead of planning their builds out...and the mod system synergizes very well with skills and other mods, weapons, or damage types, depending on the build that you want to go for...which is great.

Is it worth 59.99?  Definitely, but I feel like a more fair price point would have been 49.99.  I can't wait to see where they go with it.

The pilot gameplay is very skilled based and rewarding when you improve and work with your minimal health and wide skill set, along with your amazing movement options to out skill other pilots and even titans if you are skilled enough to not be smashed to pieces while going for their power cell.

And the titan gameplay makes you feel powerful,yet paranoid as you become a focused on target,with the feeling that in the moment you are one of the key players in the game. Forcing you to use your titan kit to slaughter through waves of grunts,reapers and pilots and have tense battles against other titans and using your limited anti pilot measures to fight off and destroy players looking for an opening to get on top and damage you for insane damage. This all makes for one of the most fun, deep, tense, fast and thrilling games I've played.

It's also extremely fun and has many rewards for continued play, and the later added ""frontier defense"" mode is a great player vs npc mode with many difficulty choices and mode only titan mods to make you feel even more powerful with up to 3 friends in a very fun power trip filled blast.

As well as a wonderful story with interesting lore and great level design[in both layout, graphics and game play twists used by many levels to keep it interesting and fresh]. And to top it all off, great main characters and fun villain/boss encounters within a story that has an emotional ending due to its good writing that gives the player a real sense of connection to he story and world that respawn builds.

Half way through the game and its still quite a blast, Haven't played the multiplayer for the story, but doing it solo is a great experience and very challenging. 
All Interactive NPC's are amazingly written they have so much character and each of them are very quirky
the Skills and Equipment abilities are fun to anyone who loves to mid max to have a specific gaming style.
Negatives
There's no Melee, They have ""Melee Skills"" the skill are awesome to use, but when your surrounded by 10 creatures your begging for at least a shove button.
They don't tell you how to get mods, i learned from sheer coincidence, Also you can only edit one slot if u have purple equipment which is weird i don't understand why they don't let u edit both.
Vaulting over anything sucks, most walls you cant vault or climb over, the rule to vaulting is if the wall is lower then your characters nipple height u can vault it.

Game Play
Fast Paced action, sitting in one place and shooting from a distance not gonna happen. The game requires lots of movement and repositioning. Skill management is not required but u should watch your cool downs. They're very useful and help out very much with crushing hoards

77929,8,Thu,Apr,2021,02:06:10,Outriders,"So greetings to everyone,

I finished the game after 26 hours and had alot of fun with it. I only played the campain so far, cant say anything about the endgame. 

My pros and cons are as follows:

Pros: 
+The story ending was quite nice, I liked it 
+The AI is pretty good, sometimes the enemies get stuck at the terrain (rarely)
+Crafting system is deep enought to customize and upgrade your gear to support your playstile
  upgrades via mods (each weapon has at least 1 mod slot) and weapon lvl
+Diffuclty adjustable at all times with the ""World level"" system (Higher tier needs to be unlocked, manged to get to tier 8 of 15)
+Play with frinds works nice
+The visuals and grafics looks great, sometimes a bit much
+The locations varied (desert, jungle, volcano, etc.)
+I liked the humor
+Multiple buffs and debuffs to handle
+Combat feels impactful
+Skilltree is divided in smaler and greater ""runes"" with connections between the different skill specifications
+The bossfights are funny, but not to complicated
+Character customization is basic, but the main character has voice
+A LOT of cutscenes

Cons:
-Ingame UI (health, ammo, abbilities etc.) doesnt load (almost evertime), had to reload the lobby
-Triggers arent loading (sometimes)
-Stutter during cutscences
-If you open a door or jump over a broken bridge => mini cutscene with no effect (didnt load the next level area or something like that) (it gets really annoying) 
-There are some heavy difficulty spikes throughout the game, can be frustrating (if you dont change the world level)
-Enemie abilities go sometimes through terrain
-In the last quater of the game I run into blackscreens and crashes (UE4-Madness error)
-The navigation in levels is sometimes hell. The map is split in smaler parts, and you can see in which part you are, but not the excact position. So what to do if youÂ´re standing in big freaking forest and everything looks similar? Right trail and error.
-The ""monsters"" in the mid/late game are way to easy to kill

I hope it was helpful! 

Stay save, Cheers",so greetings to everyone i finished the game after twenty six hours and had alot of fun with it i only played the campain so far cant say anything about the endgame my pros and cons are as follows pros the story ending was quite nice i liked it the ai is pretty good sometimes the enemies get stuck at the terrain rarely crafting system is deep enought to customize and upgrade your gear to support your playstile upgrades via mods each weapon has at least one mod slot and weapon lvl diffuclty adjustable at all times with the world level system higher tier needs to be unlocked manged to get to tier eight of one5 play with frinds works nice the visuals and grafics looks great sometimes a bit much the locations varied desert jungle volcano etc i liked the humor multiple buffs and debuffs to handle combat feels impactful skilltree is divided in smaler and greater runes with connections between the different skill specifications the bossfights are funny but not to complicated character customization is basic but the main character has voice a lot of cutscenes cons ingame ui health ammo abbilities etc doesnt load almost evertime had to reload the lobby triggers arent loading sometimes stutter during cutscences if you open a door or jump over a broken bridge mini cutscene with no effect didnt load the next level area or something like that it gets really annoying there are some heavy difficulty spikes throughout the game can be frustrating if you dont change the world level enemie abilities go sometimes through terrain in the last quater of the game i run into blackscreens and crashes ue4 madness error the navigation in levels is sometimes hell the map is split in smaler parts and you can see in which part you are but not the excact position so what to do if you re standing in big freaking forest and everything looks similar right trail and error the monsters in the mid late game are way to easy to kill i hope it was helpful stay save cheers,finished game hours alot fun played campain endgame pros cons pros ending nice pretty enemies stuck terrain rarely crafting system deep enought customize upgrade gear support playstile upgrades mods weapon mod slot weapon lvl diffuclty adjustable times world level system higher tier unlocked manged tier one5 play frinds works nice visuals grafics great bit locations varied desert jungle volcano humor multiple buffs debuffs handle combat feels impactful skilltree divided smaler greater runes connections skill specifications bossfights funny complicated character customization basic character voice lot cutscenes cons ingame ui health ammo abbilities doesnt load evertime reload lobby triggers arent loading stutter cutscences open door jump broken mini cutscene effect didnt load level area annoying heavy difficulty game frustrating dont change world level enemie abilities terrain quater game run blackscreens crashes ue4 madness error navigation levels hell map split smaler parts part excact position standing big freaking similar trail error monsters mid late game easy kill helpful stay save cheers,finished game hours alot fun played campain endgame pros cons pros ending nice pretty enemies stuck terrain rarely crafting system deep enought customize upgrade gear support playstile upgrades mods weapon mod slot weapon lvl diffuclty adjustable times world level system higher tier unlocked manged tier one5 play frinds works nice visuals grafics great bit locations varied desert jungle volcano humor multiple buffs debuffs handle combat feels impactful skilltree divided smaler greater runes connections skill specifications bossfights funny complicated character customization basic character voice lot cutscenes cons ingame ui health ammo abbilities doesnt load evertime reload lobby triggers arent loading stutter cutscences open door jump broken mini cutscene effect didnt load level area annoying heavy difficulty game frustrating dont change world level enemie abilities terrain quater game run blackscreens crashes ue4 madness error navigation levels hell map split smaler parts part excact position standing big freaking similar trail error monsters mid late game easy kill helpful stay save cheers,1,1,0.523809552

Edit - later, ignoring the multiplayer aspect and just trying to find the GAME in the game, I give up. I tried. This game really sucks. There's no substance to it. No story line, no interesting characters (let alone character arcs), it's just ""wander around risking your life collecting trash so you can build stuff that helps you collect more trash"". It takes so long to make any real progress on leveling up so you can do more stuff, meanwhile you're getting your ass kicked by nonsensical gibberish ""enemies"" with no discernible lore (or charm, for that matter)... Fallout 4 is so much better in EVERY way.

2nd Edit - I keep trying like crazy to like this game. It's finally starting to grow on me, a little bit. I still have to settle for occasionally waving at another player since there is no chat, but that's as ""multiplayer"" as it gets for me. I'm treating it as a single-player game with occasional outsiders peeking in on 'my' game once in awhile, waving as they pass silently through. I think I can make something somewhat enjoyable out of it in spite of its flaws, but it's never going to measure up to FO4.

3rd edit - Still not worth it. Still trying to like it. I just log on and am in the middle of a goddamned super mutant attack - no time to think, no time to ease into the game... It's just too much, for too little enjoyment. It takes too damned long to level up, and the ""story"" you get to deal with while you do is just plain dumb. The ""ally"" you get is vapid and shallow and obnoxiously flowery and pleasant and won't shut the f*ck up...

Besides some login issues, the game launched fine. It worked. It was fun to play, I beat the campaign with a couple of friends and then we started doing the endgame content which, while we didn't like it being only time based, it still provided some challenge and fun. Along with that the loot was compelling and the various abilities on armour and weapons, plus the set bonuses, add unique ways to play.

Then the first patch came. The first of many patches, and with every patch the game became worse, and worse, and worse. Inventory wipes, downscaling issues, enemies one shotting you, you name it. It looks almost like they are actively trying to kill their own game. Needless to say the number of players dropped to almost zero.

I'd love to see this game first and foremost brought back to a decent state, like the launch, and then be improved with compelling and not time based endgame, a real matchmaking system, and more.

91480,29,Wed,Jun,2022,01:43:55,Titanfall 2,"Dear reader,

This game might just be the most fun I have ever had in an FPS game. It is the most brilliantly crafted experience to have ever been released on Steam. The campaign alone is worth the price, especially when it is on sale.

The story of this game is fairly standard as far as sci-fi FPS games go, this is no RDR2, but it is engaging and well written. Characters are well realized, especially for this genre, with BT being one of the best sidekick characters I have seen in gaming ever. 

Now the real reason it is incredible: gameplay. This game is fantastic. Its main mechanics, parkour and shooting, are implemented really well in a way that is always fun and makes you feel way better at the game than you really are.

Gunplay is amazing, with personal preference deciding which weapons and titan load-outs you use. Which reminds me: the titans. Titan fights are amazingly fun and spaced perfectly throughout the game to add some variation. New powers and loadouts make each fight feel fantastically unique.

Graphics are really good, the game holds up really well in 2022, despite using an engine from 2001. Source is amazing.

Now the sad bit, multiplayer. This game has been abandoned and filled with hackers. Servers been ddos attacked. Very sad. There appear to be mods to help with this, [strike] but I have not tried them yet [/strike] , I may edit this in the future when I have (I have now). But even without multiplayer, this game is WELL worth it's price just for the campaign.

EDIT TIME!: after trying Northstar I can say with absolute certainty that the abandonment of this game is an absolute tragedy. The multiplayer is amazing. I have not encountered any cheaters so far using Northstar, and the multiplayer is just as fun as it's single-player campaign. Getting killed makes you feel impressed instead of mad!

Story: 7/10
Characters: 10/10
Gameplay: 10/10
Graphics: 10/10
Multiplayer: 9/10
Performance: 10/10 - great for low end PCs
Linux support: deck certified
Length: about 6 hours - infinite with multiplayer
Value: great even when not on sale, an absolute must buy on sale

Going back to another FPS feels like a regression.

EDIT: revamped review to be more structured and highlight the issues I had

Coop
First off: 3-player coop max? WTF? Why not 4 like 90% of other coop games? -- I know devs gave an answer to this, but it's literally ""Testing shows that 3 ""feels"" best for our testers"" -- rather than sticking with decades-long convention and letting players decide this for themselves. Numerous times I wanted to delve into another 2-player friend group to bump it up to 4 players but this just wasn't possible.

## Story / The  ""scifi"" setting (Without spoiling):
Started off really cool and fascinating. but I felt the sci-fi and alien-ness of the story to get less so and fall towards really old and cliche tropes near the end. A lot of the alien encounters feel like something I feel like I would see out of resident evil or some other horror-mutationy game than I would of a scifi ""completely alien and incomprehensible"" world kind of one. Lore doesnt' really explain how anything works and the ways in which it does left me feeling kind of underwhelmed when it was actually implemented. Starting off the world seemed really inspiring and wondrous but as the story and lore unraveled, I felt really disappointing in the lack of variance and alienness coming from the design of the planet's inhabitants, just mutated to be more beefy, big and a couple other mutations.Also why does this planet have so many fucking GUNS?! Why are these god-like entities using guns when they're basically walking forces of supernatural destruction?

## Immersion breaking
More. 2-second. cutscenes. every. hour. than. periods. in. this. sentence.
No seriously, they have cutscenes for every trivial and benign thing with a black-out ""loading"" kind of feeling to show it, then ""Black out"" again. Cutting off audio and often left me wondering ""Why isn't this just an animation"" rather than a dedicated cutscene for it? Especially in regards to area transitions and boss encounters. Open a door? CUTSCENE, boss changing phases/dying, CUTSCENE! Honestly the way they tackled this feels like a very amatuerish approach.

## Gunplay
Why do enemy miniguns sound like someone tapping a desk rapidly? Gun shots and 'feel' like toys and don't really make me feel like they're satisfying to fire-- Also, DAMAGE FALLOFF why does my SMG lose ALL damage after 15 meters? Shotguns just straight up won't hit your target at that range. I HATE games that use ""bullet dropoff"" for balancing. Just use accuacy / inaccuracy with pellet count like nearly every other shooter does.This left me ignoring certain gun categories that initially seemed cool because you have to practically be in melee range for something that seems like it should be at least feasible to use at mid-range like an SMG. And If I see an enemy at 1% like at 50 meters, let me use my shotgun and hope a pellet grazes him. I don't get why my bullet feels like they loose all momentum after 15 meters. 

## Build variance
Playing the fire class; A lot of builds will work in the early game when things have no HP and don't do any damage. But as you progress through the game and keeping up with world tier, certain builds just don't scale enough to keep up. Trying to scale all hardcore into abilities you'll do 1/10th the damage of someone just going guns. Most of my abilities felt like falling into that warframe-y feel where some abilities are totally ignored because they just don't scale or do enough damage. Typically the only good skills are ""round"" skills that modify your magazine and other utility/buffer skills. CC skills end up becoming useless in the endgame since the throngs of ""strong"" enemies are mostly CC immune anyways. 

I tried the assassiny class, but it's utterly laughable to think anyone is going to live in melee in the mid/late game with the amount of unblockable BS attacks that are going to be slammed against you. 

Friend tried turret class, but sadly wasn't able to get much build variance with turrets falling through the floor constantly.

If you care at all about public matchmaking, don't both with the tank class since they're frequently kicked out of public groups due to their low damage and squishiness-- and current balance doesn't make them needed since other classes are tankier.

Ultimately Shooter builds triumph all other builds. Likely because it's very easy to hardcore scale guns than it is to scale abilities. Ability (anomaly) power isn't anywhere near as powerful as the insane combination and stacking buffs you get for your guns.

""Round"" skills are VERY powerful buffs to guns that everyone rolls with in the end-game-- this is also the reason why the tank class is completely ""underpowered"" is because they don't have one of these skills while everyone else does.

## Endgame
Due to balance, there only 1 viable build for 3 classes and no viable build for the fourth (Round skills OP). Everything turns into gear-checks and the leveling/gear system has exponential power. Every level you *must* replace or upgrade (Immensely grindy) all of your gear otherwise you're missing out on 20-30% power/armor per level multiplicatively. It's only a 3-4 level difference before the gear has double the stats. Legendary items getting replaced with blue items that are only a few levels higher. Upgrading blues isn't too bad, but trying ot upgrade your purple/legendary is impractically expensive. You'll spend hours trying to upgrade it once-- and by that time you're already so far progressed you'll need to upgrade it multiple times and need exponentially more time to grind to keep it caught up.

## Items
Crafting system is okay, as with above I hate the level-exponential power system. Each level on the gear seems to add ~20-30% power to the item, so only a couple levels and your gear needs total replacing. Really frustrating to do 20 times and feels like those hard-earned legendary become pea canon after 30 minutes. More often then not, you'll salvage your legendary since it'll be more useful to you that way. 

Store wise, I absolutely hate the system. You either salvage items to get parts for crafting, or you sell them to merchants. The cost of items in the stores goes up exponentially with level as well, so as you save up to buy something-- turns out you need to save even more since you leveled up. This repeats until you hit end-game and need to spend an hour grinding to buy one item. And god forbid you want to buy one of the shiny purple/yellow items in which case, happy fun grinding days to get it.",bugs crashed technical issues and the rest aside assuming you get none of that and it seem like most people do i still wouldn t recommend this edit revamped review to be more structured and highlight the issues i had coop first off three player coop max wtf why not four like

77183,8,Thu,Apr,2021,22:26:09,Outriders,"Unfortunate buggy mess of a trash game. I'm not even going to extensively cover the server launch issues or the lack of offline multiplayer.

As of now, there is an ""unbalance"" of build variety in the higher levels of the game, mostly skewed towards the ""technomancer"". Maybe he is busted and the game needs some sort of rebalancing, but the devs overreacted to the communities impression based on the top .001 percent of grinders and content creators. Did I mention that the dev's ""solution"" was to nerf the trickster into the ground? TLDR, the upcoming update is only going to make the barrier of entry into the end game more difficult for the casual playerbase. The upcoming nerfs are unnecessary and make no sense whatsoever, it's a reactionary decision based on reddit memes made by scrubs for a game barely even a week old! I can't believe they're listening to kids who think they have a fresh looter game's meta solved within 5 days, absolute nonsense. 

The gameplay is pretty fun when it actually works, but this is where it becomes a buggy mess. My shots will consistently just CLIP through random enemies while doing absolutely no damage. Some skills used by the trickster are completely unreliable due to how buggy they are, ranging from working only half assed to not activating at all. 

Now let's go over the other extensive list of glaring flaws that may completely turn you off the game. 

1.) Flipping cutscenes for literally everything, you want to open a door? Time to cut to a long drawn out scene where your character slowly opens a door. It's literally every 5 minutes in the game, get used to it.

2.) The story started out not bad, then takes a turn for the worse midway through and becomes an ""Avatar"" ripoff with the same social commentary we've heard a million times before. Yeah we get it, white man bad, natives good, westernization bad. This sentiment has only been forced down our throats literally every day

3.) Did I mention that they took a jab at the DC ""rednecks"" with their blatant one-liner in the game? It's literally in the demo. You don't have to agree or disagree with their obvious left winged agenda, all I'm saying is that it's probably not a good idea to potentially alienate half of your audience with your snyde political quips. 

4.) Literally every single character is not likeable at all, except maybe the main character. Everyone whines and complains, or they're one-dimensional whiny and bitchy husks

5.) Glitches.... Glitches everywhere

6.) Server issues, everywhere

I tried to like this game, I even defended it for the longest time solely based on the cool combat concepts. Overlooked the glaring flaws previously outlined, and I didn't even mention a bunch of others. The classes are all really cool in theory and the Diablo + Shooter hybrid idea is interesting. The gameplay is even fun when it actually works! Which is why it's so sad for me to say that this game just feels bad to play and the devs have literally no balls. 

I'm not the type of person to waste my time review bombing a game, but you guys are the exception. Props for that. Joke's on me though, you already have my money ""people can fly."" I seriously hope you all fail miserably though

I'm no stranger to ""Day 1"" patches, but this game is on a whole different level. This game is a monument to the developers incompetence. If you release a game SOO F-ING BROKEN that it can't even be played in single player on launch day then you shouldn't be making games. Who makes a game in 2021 where you can't jump or climb shoulder height walls? Who makes a game in 2021 where you HAVE TO BE ONLINE TO PLAY SINGLEPLAYER? No hud, no gun crosshairs, NO CROSSPLAY, servers crashing every day since launch, graphics are unremarkable and look like a b grade game, choppy cutscenes on high end gaming desktop, wall detection for cover attachment is sketchy AT BEST and you cant climb or jump walls that you can in any other game in this age, no crossplay chat YES THATS CORRECT, YOU CANT TALK TO PEOPLE PLAYING ON A DIFFERENT PLATFORM!!! What the f@# is the point of playing together if we cant talk??????? Had to restart both my character and my friends twice due to the game deleting our  entire inventory because of glitches, latency in co-op is so bad my friend is taking damage before AI is making a move on his screen. WHY did you people make a demo before launch if you didn't use the data gathered from it to fix this trash fire? STOP SELLING US BROKEN GAMES ON LAUNCH YOU MONEY HUNGRY DEVS. I'm looking at you too CYBERPUNK. EVEN THOUGH CYBERPUNK WAS BROKEN, I COULD AT LEAST PLAY THE POS. I will NEVER buy a game new again, it will be several months after release before i buy ANY game from now on.

Yes the writing is awful for the most part, especially the story BUT there is SO MUCH LOVE for fans aside from that BS, in terms of gameplay, character tributes, quality of life improvements, music, AMAZING new guns, being able to become Mirror's Edge effectively with all the parkour, much bigger maps and thus scale, an absolutely RELENTLESS spam of Legendaries, Purple and Blue loot, a MUCH improved bank and shared storage  system, a MUCH improved co-op system that has to be seen to be be believed and so on!

Aside from terrible writing and narrative choices, there is IMMENSE love, effort, improvement, quality of life, pro player choices and just SHEER amount of fun, hilarity, chaos and stuff WAY beyond the previous games too!

I really, really, really love this game, the new planets are amazing, the new characters are SO MUCH fun to play (wish they added new ones but the new skill trees are FANTASTIC) and Arms Race mode is a very mixed bag but pretty fun and stupid, both for the right and wrong reasons too.

I absolutely recommend this game. Its my favourite Borderlands game now easily. I REALLY love Borderlands 2 and Pre-Sequel especially but I'm having so much fun and so happy with this, especially in co-op too where Borderland EXCELS too, all the other major flaws are much less worse in comparison, or a lot more manageable.

Also this game DOESN'T spam you with microtransactions, lootboxes, battle passes etc. It respects us, the players, the consumers like that. Randy Pitchford was AGAINST it, he didn't want to cheapen the game like that and make it immensely greedier and exploitative. They went so PRO consumer/fan/player whatever in this and there is a LOT to love about this game if you give it a chance, I PROMISE! 

Absolutely amazing set pieces, great voice acting, still some hilarious parts and moments, TRULY EPIC battles and bosses including a brilliant guest appearance by Penn and Teller as side characters/major villains or whatever and so on.

This is how games should be generally and I hope Gearbox maintains this standard for Borderlands 4 and future games, aside from the shoddy writing generally. There is still good writing here too, its a very mixed bag but major parts of the story are awful for certain major spoiler reasons.

I do really love the focus on Jakobs, Atlas and Maliwan too, I waited YEARS for those to happen, especially Maliwan and It makes me extremely happy to see that dream come true too.

I could keep going on and on, but I really wholeheatedly love this game and will proudly praise and defend it too. Its very underrated and far too hated.

It has an interesting story line, with some genuinely good dialogue (once we pass that first rough area), and deals with some severe themes by the time the main story concludes. I was skeptical at first of the price of the DLC, for instance, but there's enough content there to make it worth it, and the developers ensured that the story goes full-circle. What's more, there's a mystery at the root of it all that sets the stage for a broader Outriders story line: it's good stuff.

At least once a day, the game will freeze for a few seconds, and then crash to desktop with the app still still running, it takes any where between 30 seconds, to 10 minutes to reopen the app and get it working again which is definitely a major problem in the game that can prevent progress, such as killing bosses or just fighting enemy. There seems to be no real cause for why the game does this and it happens whenever it feels like it. Another technical issue, although no where as major, is seen when the game is closed, for about 15-30 seconds there will be a black window that takes up about 3/5 of the screen, just a nuisance to have to wait for it to disappear.

When I first played this game, it was when the game first came out. Needless to say, it was trash. I genuinely did not enjoy this game, even as an avid/die-hard Fallout fan. The biggest problem the game had, besides the glitches, was the lack of npc's in the game besides robots and enemies. Because of those problems alone, I quit playing and I never looked back.

When I saw that they finally added npc's into the game, I was happy that they were pushing the game in the right direction. I finally decided to play again when Steel Dawn came out, and I have never been more blown away with the transformation of this game. It feels like a completely different game from the one I played almost 3 years ago. It feels smoother, more fluid, and has more of a community than when I first played it.

In conclusion, yes I believe people should give this game a chance again just as I have. There are still glitches that will probably never change, but overall this game has been an enjoyable experience that I can't wait to keep experiencing. Good job, Bethesda.
