117291,17,Sat,Apr,2021,21:15:57,Destiny 2,"PROS:

- Destiny as a game blends MMO and FPS aspects quite well together. 
- The story, lore and narrative have been some of the best put out there in the recent years and has created a universe that I personally think is a big as franchises such as The elder scrolls series or others of that calibre. 
- The abilities range from a frozen fist that you can hit combatants with to summing a flame sword you can throw projectiles with. 
- The selection of guns and armour is enormous with new editions every major update.
- End game content is really fun and a great goal to work towards
- The Destiny community is great (lots of people looking to do end game content for people who don't have friends that also play the game)
- End game content has some challenge to it

CONS:

- The current balancing of PVP game modes is a mess and direly requires a change as it affects PVE balancing indirectly and vice versa. (It makes PVP really frustrating for the end game/competitive content)
- Dry spots in between content releases is rather common (about 3 months after a content drop that lasts around a month with the current schedule for content)
- End game content has a challenge to it (mostly mechanic heavy and debuffs making harder to kill enemies)
- Weekly limit to how much you can level up at certain levels

Should you pick this game up?

I've played this game and its predecessor since their initial launches respectively over the past ~7 years and I always seem to come back and play this game no matter how long it's been between binges. Destiny is a lot of fun but it's different for other MMOs out there. Most of that being the lack of being to grind for items over and over (Raids for example can only be done 3 times a week/once per character every week). If you are into MMO games I'm sure you'll enjoy this game a lot. New to MMOs? The base game is free to play so you can try it out before you invest money into the DLC content that provides you with the bulk of the content they provide yearly.",pros destiny as a game blends mmo and fps aspects quite well together the story lore and narrative have been some of the best put out there in the recent years and has created a universe that i personally think is a big as franchises such as the elder scrolls series or others of that calibre the abilities range from a frozen fist that you can hit combatants with to summing a flame sword you can throw projectiles with the selection of guns and armour is enormous with new editions every major update end game content is really fun and a great goal to work towards the destiny community is great lots of people looking to do end game content for people who don t have friends that also play the game end game content has some challenge to it cons the current balancing of pvp game modes is a mess and direly requires a change as it affects pve balancing indirectly and vice versa it makes pvp really frustrating for the end game competitive content dry spots in between content releases is rather common about three months after a content drop that lasts around a month with the current schedule for content end game content has a challenge to it mostly mechanic heavy and debuffs making harder to kill enemies weekly limit to how much you can level up at certain levels should you pick this game up i ve played this game and its predecessor since their initial launches respectively over the past seven years and i always seem to come back and play this game no matter how long it s been between binges destiny is a lot of fun but it s different for other mmos out there most of that being the lack of being to grind for items over and over raids for example can only be done three times a week once per character every week if you are into mmo games i m sure you ll enjoy this game a lot new to mmos the base game is free to play so you can try it out before you invest money into the dlc content that provides you with the bulk of the content they provide yearly,pros game blends mmo fps aspects narrative put recent years created universe personally big franchises scrolls series calibre abilities frozen fist hit combatants summing flame sword throw projectiles selection guns enormous editions update end game content fun great goal work community great lots people end game content people friends play game end game content challenge cons current balancing pvp game modes mess direly requires change affects pve balancing indirectly versa makes pvp frustrating end game competitive content dry spots content releases common months content drop lasts current schedule content end game content challenge mechanic heavy debuffs making kill enemies limit level levels pick game played game predecessor initial launches past years play game matter binges lot fun mmos lack grind items raids times character mmo games enjoy game lot mmos base game play invest dlc content bulk content provide,pros game blends mmo fps aspects narrative put recent years created universe personally big franchises scrolls series calibre abilities frozen fist hit combatants summing flame sword throw projectiles selection guns enormous editions update end game content fun great goal work community great lots people end game content people friends play game end game content challenge cons current balancing pvp game modes mess direly requires change affects pve balancing indirectly versa makes pvp frustrating end game competitive content dry spots content releases common months content drop lasts current schedule content end game content challenge mechanic heavy debuffs making kill enemies limit level levels pick game played game predecessor initial launches past years play game matter binges lot fun mmos lack grind items raids times character mmo games enjoy game lot mmos base game play invest dlc content bulk content provide,1,1,0.483750343,8,11,-0.16,0.63,1967,374.0,0.11,149.64,374.0,41,139,1.46,4,5.26,139,0.9994,2

35064,7,Tue,Feb,2023,22:52:22,Elden Ring,"I have been playing FROM Software games since DS1 came out on the 360. I have tried to like these games over and over. I have played DS1 from many different angles and many different classes, but have never seen the appeal. To me, playing these games just feels like training yourself to be really good at executing a half-baked feedback loop process with extremely broken tools, and Elden Ring is no exception. Not only does this game exemplify everything wrong with the design of FROM games, but it doesn't even do it in an original or groundbreaking way like lots of people would have you believe. The combat is almost exactly like DS1, and the bosses are an odd hybrid of styles and presentation from Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro. The open world is lifeless and dull, and the game dumps needlessly obtuse exposition with no explanation of other parts of the lore or why you as the player should care. It's just ""go on a great quest, oh chosen Undead!"" Yeah, I haven't seen that anywhere else... except it's the premise for every FROM game since Dark Souls. Truly I am absolutely baffled as to how this game won any awards, much less Game of the Year. If you want a video game that you can install, have fun with, and put down until you wanna play again, this is NOT the game for you. If you like games where you have to sink an extreme amount of time and research into the world's lore, the broken combat system, and the general obtuse and bloated design of the game in hopes that you MIGHT be capable of squeezing out even the smallest crumbs of fun from it, then be my guest here. Hopefully I can at least get a refund so I can say I spent my money on a game I will actually play instead of a game that I boot up, play for 5 minutes, be reminded why I didn't buy at launch, die due to broken hit detection, and turn off again for 3 or 4 more weeks.
Maybe I'm old school, but I think video games should be fun right out of the box. Part of the reason I love PC gaming specifically is because there is so much variety to be had in terms of game experiences, whether in terms of ""pick up and play"" or ""big time sink"" type games like this one. And that is definitely not to say that all games that require you to put time and research into them are bad; some of my favorite games are Stalker, Silent Hill, and Disco Elysium, all games that require you to retain and put effort into the world and just being in the game. But this game, to me, epitomizes the soulless AAA product machine that gaming has become. ""Explore the open world!"" Why? Is there anything worth seeing there? Is there a good story? Or does everything in this game ultimately serve as just fluff in between hours of grinding that you're expected to just enjoy without any clear motivation as to why you should be enjoying it? And even then, when the story DOES show up, it's the exact same pseudo-verbose fake Tolkien crap FROM has been spoon-feeding their blood-loyal fans since Dark Souls. 
Seriously, if you want to waste your time ""getting gud"" at a broken ass game, at least do it with Bloodborne. You'd be doing yourself a service to save up the money to buy a PS4 just to buy Bloodborne over playing this one. I'm probably SOL on getting a refund, so if you see I have higher hours now than when I wrote this review, it is because I am simply trying to complete the game to get my money's worth and uninstall

I would argue that some of the classes are silly and pointless. Not really a fan of the character choices in this game. Feels like a step backwards IMO. 

Flak - Really easy but not that exciting to use.
Siren - Would rather have actual fist person then siren that uses her fists... let the siren do more siren type things then punch with magic. 
Agent Smith - He likes clones... whats new... doesnt do much damage late game at times also has boring tech trees.
Mech Lady - She is fun and the only person I found to be interesting. But still has classes that 'really seem silly and unhelpful'  

NO NEW DLC characters... I feel like this was a bad move... Mainly because the '4th' skill tree added was really dumb IMO. None of the new tree's seemed to have added or build on any of the other classes. 

DLC maps - Have been very very short IMO... you pay good money for a mini campaign... Only enjoyed the jackpot DLC so far.

It's the most fun I've ever had with these games, and the first time I've felt so confident in the systems that I started doing my own challenge runs just for the fun of it. If you liked previous souls games, you'll love this one. My advice if you're new to the genre, the game is only as difficult as you let it be. If you take the time to explore, experiment and learn the mechanics and systems than you can trivialize any fight in this game, no skill required. Don't beat your head against a wall trying to kill the same boss you're struggling on, leave and explore.

62457,20,Thu,Jan,2022,09:48:43,Outriders,"This game feels very average at first. It does get better, but it never becomes amazing. It is enjoyable enough to give a playthrough, but not enough to play endgame like Destiny. When I first started playing, I had several crashes and issues that ultimately resolved themselves. The game is easy enough to start, but as I progressed and raised the world tier, enemies started to have a ton of health, hit like trucks, and sometimes flooded me quickly. Many of the enemies are super aggressive and quick and fights turn into slow battles running around very small arenas trying to not get pounced on by another four legged enemy. I started to struggle at world Tier 12, and realized I just needed to switch to a more effective build. Once I did so, I easily hit world tier 15.

The combat is okay, it's not really my type of combat. I prefer more traditional FPS games. The skills are fun for the class that I played and I switched them up as I obtained new ones and found several combos that worked well. You can reset your spec at any time, as often as you like, for no cost, which is a nice touch. You can swap your skills out whenever you want, which is great, and the items enhance the skills, which encouraged me to try out other skills and different combinations. The ability to mod gear and weapons to accentuate my play style felt very satisfying.

The story is interesting, but is a standard ""we left earth because of catastrophic blank, we used cryostatis because we don't have FTL, and then blank happened when we got there, so some people are still in cryo, and now we are stranded in a dystopian future trying to make it work"" story. That judgement made, the story is quite fleshed out in the notes that are scattered and I found them interesting to read. The final story arc, while had an interesting reveal, was not as good as the buildup.

The graphics are pretty meh. Graphics aren't a huge selling point for me, but in a game like this, I'd expect it. Character models for modern games are definitely better than this. I found my female character in a sleeveless armor piece, and the arm modeling is pathetic. The game's cutscenes felt weird, the camera jostles around a lot, and camera angle changes felt very unnatural and abrupt.

The sound effects in this game, while in some ways are great, they feel out of place. Your character sounds like a giant robot when you walk off a ledge and land. Everything sounds very clunky, steps are heavy. The quest location noise was very reminiscent and was reminding me of something, I couldn't quite put my finger on it. I did not realize for quite a while that this game was made by the same dev as Bulletstorm, but that was it! The music at times is decent, but most of the time it feels very out of place.

While this is by no means an amazing game, I picked it up at a greatly reduced price and I more than got my money's worth out of it. I went at a very casual pace, doing all of the side-quests, struggling in some areas, but eventually getting through the game in roughly 50 hours. That's a solid investment in my opinion. Even at the asking price, it's probably worth it for those that like this type of shooter. But if it's on sale, it's definitely worth it. I didn't care for it enough to stick around for endgame content, but I'm sure that increases the value for many.",this game feels very average at first it does get better but it never becomes amazing

76244,9,Fri,Apr,2021,21:21:26,Outriders,"I wanted to write a near fully detailed review of this game. But with character limit to do so, I'll try to keep this as short as possible.

I want to first state that the game was fun.

Was.

Even with the frustrations with the UI, notifications, needlessly long and constant 1.5 fade-to-black transitions for almost every little thing I did; the inconsistent and frustrating downtime of networking issues on the first 3 days of launch, the questionable drop rates at higher tiers, and even the really cruddy situations of having my character stuck in a jittery walking animation when in co-op which resulted in more DBNOs than should have been required.

Even with all of that I was still having fun. But honestly...this recent update took that away, and that is part of a larger problem in game industry thinking and resolving issues that has become a cultural work problem that needs to end somehow some way.

I had fun when this wasn't in a Developer Versus Player mindset of what was ""overpowered""

The game promotes being overpowered. 

So they should have leaned into that, they should have brought in a buff to the other classes ans subclass trees and blah blah blah...

This isn't the first time this has happened in such a conceptually sound and FUN game.

And honestly I didn't even care it was a distorted human centipede clone of several games I've played in the past, because for the genres that this game touches and goes through, this game was FUN. For years third person shooters and looter games have been going downhill on the aspect of repetitive looping FUN and it was showing. This game was a breather from all of that. A small breather, but enough to signal other games within the third person shooter with looter genre aspects was the way to go.

And that way-to-go was player agency. And FUN.

Yes the 50-60% (that's WAY TOO MUCH) of a debuff made things harder. The thing is...

I don't want Hard, and I don't want Just a Nerf and Only A Nerf. 

I wanted to play the other classes and subclass trees and I needed those underperforming aspects to be lifted. I want and NEED that buff.

I expected to see a lean into the FUN part of going ""hey, DPS is working! Let's buff up the other trees and classes so that way that fun can be [i]Maintained[/i].

Instead I have to deal with what I dealt with in another 3rd person shooter that will not be named but has made the same first update mistakes that seem so typical nowadays it's not even worth buying action games anymore, let alone single player pve looters.

Square Enix and/or People Can Fly took the fun out of a game--and again, this isn't the first time this has happened in the industry. But it's happened again and I'm not surprised, but I'm very, extremely frustrated.

I came in for the fun of the game, not to work. I didn't even want this game to be a Job. And with how they've chose the options of their definition of balancing, it shows that they are transparent with their choices--for sure--but they're showing the path of that transparency and it is not with their fanbase at all. The patch notes alone looked like some PR twit wrote them down and had a lot of misconstrued explanations of what was being changed.

I was going to recommend this used-to-be FUN game to my friends. Heck I was going to gift it when I could! But I feel like this is another game that has to go trough the 6 month wringer of waiting till it's either fun again or just barely bearable to play...again.

Will I still play this game during this mess? I don't know. I hope so. Because even with these terrible choices it's still a fun game, but having a Nothing But Nerf outlook seems to be the way that this is going to go for a while.

But I got a question for People Can Fly, Square Enix, and the rest of the ""AAA"" industry.

Are your games just jobs at this point?

If so...I already have one job. I don't need another.

And I absolutely don't need to have another Developer Versus Player experience in a game that has the potential to be FUN,

You, People Can Fly, had the opportunity to break that nasty cycle of thinking and you didn't, you caved. And that is honestly and professionally disappointing and depressing.

For anyone waiting on this game: I want to say ""give it time"" and maybe that's what you need to do....again.

 And again, if you have the feeling you're going to need to have that conversation with the gaming industry's definition of what Player Agency is...you ain't alone in that feeling. 

Because once again, a fun game like this, is showing that their updates are going to deny that for a length of time before they break their No Fun Allowed sign that they slapped you with.

The Mayhem Mode is an interesting twist, and the dlc's are in keeping with the Borderlands themes.

As far as my favorite dlc, I would have to go with Arms Race. I know it's not popular, but it lets you try out the full array of guns and modifications on world drop guns, and you can play it as soon as you get on the ship.

I Loughed at F76 since it came out... but they fixed it by making a Single player Wastelanders DLC which is a game changer. 
The World is absolutely Beautiful with lots of quests and NPC's and you can play it Solo and complete all main and side quests alone. If you play in a group , it's fun too.

Every article i read saying you need to be in team to go to a Silo and lunch a nuke is a Lie and joke , i did it with no issues at all on level 70 or so... And Level 70 .. you will get there by doing all quests and visiting all locations actually quick...

What to expect ? : You can't save , technically... ,you pay for fast travel with Caps and if you want only single player Fallout experience just ignore others around you or join a friend's private server if you can , and BTW there are not that many players at the same time on some servers.

As expected from AAA bethesda ...it is plagued with bugs and broken quests but None that would truly prevent you from having a great experience.

The lore is in-depth and interesting like previous Fromsoft games, the OST is on point, and the combat is a more complex and refined version of the combat in Dark Souls 3. The ashes of war system is really well-done is this game and I liked the variety it added to combat. I understand the issue with dungeon/ boss repetition but I believe this is difficult to avoid in an open-world game. I also do believe the balance is thrown off by the open-world + spirit ashes leading to bosses oftentimes becoming too hard or too easy. In my experience the game was the easiest out of the Fromsoft games I played but this isn't the mark of a bad game. I used the mimic tear and (for Godfrey and Melenia) the rivers of blood. This led to the game being easier for me but there were still plenty of times were I was bested by levels/bosses. It is much easier to become OP in Elden Ring compared to other games in the Souls series but you can always consciously avoid certain items to make the game more difficult. The amazing world design coupled with the great combat system make this game truly great.

16065,23,Sun,May,2021,13:47:32,Borderlands 3,"Gearbox think they landed on the holy grail of FPS games when they invented Borderlands. The only thing they got right was how to make an FPS RPG work. Since then and it's been apparent from the second game, Borderlands is now the FIFA of FPS games except the meme goes that only the graphics change but for Borderlands this isn't the case. What changes is the amount of greed in the eyes of Gearbox.

The game isn't free to play so I have no idea how they can justify Â£8 for a skin when the base game is Â£50. I have season pass one and I haven't even played Krieg's Fantastic Fustercluck. The game is just repetitive drivel that's really easy to level up, Legendaries are over abundant, harder difficulties are bullet sponges, and the only way the designers know how to create a raid boss is to have it spend most of it's time invincible because they don't want them beaten by solo players.

What makes Borderlands even worse is that it's even easier to cheat than most other games on the market, you don't even need a hex editor to do it. The save files for Borderlands are pretty much an open book so players can obtain any weapon or unlock ALL abilities without any issue. Missions are exploitable for loot or, if you ever played BL2, the infamous Grog Nozzle + Gunzerker combo was unstoppable!

In an era where games companies like Activision and Electronic Arts are becoming accountable for their greed and destruction. Gearbox said ""hold my beer"". You can buy the designer's cut for Â£11.99 and get four skins or you can spend Â£32.96 for four Â£7.99 skins separately. The truth is Season Pass Two is NOT a season pass, it's a DLC and even with all the elements of the Season Pass Two stuck together it's shorter and has less content than any of Season Pass One's individual content.

Gearbox stop treating Borderlands like the World of Warcraft of FPS games because it's not by a landslide and never has been. I don't want to be bombarded with stupid Cartel Thugs just because you have an event on, I want to continue my progression through the story in peace. I don't need to go online and form a party with 3 random strangers so I can fight a raid boss for a single weapon because the first player I meet will drop it with cheats anyway.

Borderlands should be a casual game to play solo or with your friends. Gearbox don't want that. They want the WoW of FPS games and your money. Or maybe just your money considering their content to cost ratio. And if Gearbox want to flag this as off topic, here's the problem, both your Season Passes are for Borderlands 3 and your company logo is all over it. So yes this is a very on topic review about your game, it's content, and the lack of consideration for returning fans of the series.",gearbox think they landed on the holy grail of fps games when they invented borderlands the only thing they got right was how to make an fps rpg work since then and it s been apparent from the second game borderlands is now the fifa of fps games except the meme goes that only the graphics change but for borderlands this isn t the case what changes is the amount of greed in the eyes of gearbox the game isn t free to play so i have no idea how they can justify eight for a skin when the base game is fifty i have season pass one and i haven t even played krieg s fantastic fustercluck the game is just repetitive drivel that s really easy to level up legendaries are over abundant harder difficulties are bullet sponges and the only way the designers know how to create a raid boss is to have it spend most of it s time invincible because they don t

Subclass 3.0 and craftable weapons have brought a level of consistency  we've never had before, this consistency does make the time investment feel more valuable but at the cost of some power creep and added learning curve. Picking up Destiny 2 during season of the plunder will be a great opportunity to experience the destiny universe and with big crucible changes coming you'll be well prepared for the pvp when the true ranked playlist is here.
edit: The crucible changes happened, I can't speak to the experience for everyone but god damn does it suck in South Africa, I placed gold and it takes so long to find a comp match that I get error coded out more than I find a match. The map selection is also kind of garbage, with weighting towards long range ones, at least pacifica is still here and I do enjoy that one. Trials is also a shitshow in my region, the matchmaking is supposed to be based on how many wins you have so I'm not expecting even/fair matches, but I shouldn't have to lose to the same team 5 times in a row. Their flawless game should not be against a team with 1 win and a flawed card. 

Champions feel more normal now but they still suck major donkey dick, unless you like teleporting enemies full healing and one shotting you. otherwise pve still as good as the last time I reviewed the game. 
edit: champions still feel garbage but the rest of the pve experience has been improved, getting past the overwhelming 3.0 and mod stuff it can be quite satisfying to exploit a custom build from your own imagination... or a youtube video, both ways are fun and you can make it work to what you enjoy. weapons feel a bit locked down because of the seasonal champ mods but at least it means you get to try different things each season.

It is a second Destiny.

There are now two of them.

But I enjoyed the first one, and so far this one is showing to be just as fun... and frustrating. 

I played countless hours of Destiny on Xbox One in high-school, but I was sceptical coming into Destiny 2 as I heard things from friends like ""It's literally just the first game again"" and ""It's like the devs went backwards"".  
But it went on sale (I know it's free, but lets be real these games aren't shit without DLC) and I grabbed it about a week ago. Now I've got a lot to say. 

The fun stuff:

Gun make big bang and brain go brrr. The gun-play is great, from the weapon design to the sounds design. It's all amazing. 

Visuals are also quite nice, and the game runs smoothly on my ancient POS I call a ""gaming PC""

I'm a huge fan of any games with collecting aspects, so that gets a plus from me as there is a stupid range of weapons and gear to hunt down.

Great class diversity, some might disagree with me on this and I know why, but more on that later.

Great enemy diversity. 

Bosses don't have way too much fucking health anymore.

MMORPG and FPS blend together really well for me. I really enjoy this genre, I'm sure there is a name for it I just don't care. 

PvP and PvE options for whatever way you want to play the game. Althogh PvE does have some issues...

The new PvEvP game mode ""Gambit"" is really fun, the execution was on point with that one. 

They plan to support the game til next year with expansions still to come, y'know, if you want to give more money to Bungi. 

The DLC's are actually pretty good. 

A lot more customisation than the first game.

Ripping around in those drifty little Star-Wars cars is fun as fuck.

Now that I've covered most of what I like about the game...

The frustrating;

To start off, what I mentioned at the start. This game IS, undeniably, just a copy paste of the first game. For the most part. 
The starting area is the same... I was genuinely shocked when I took control of my character for the first time. I 100% was convinced I accidentally launched Destiny, which I don't even own on PC. It was baffling to me that you would start a sequel to a game with the exact same first level. 
Imagine, you just bought your first copy of Halo 2. You put the game into your Xbox and suddenly you feel a strange sense of familiarity as a you are awoken from a Cryo Pod and have to go find Captain Keyes again, I think even a 11 year old would go ""What the fuck, I did this already"". The only reason Bungi could've done this was to save money. It bothers me even 20 hours of gameplay later. 
The classes are the same for the most part. I guess theres more sub-classes or whatever but fuck that they shoulda added a fourth class to the game. Even the borderlands series, one of the most copy-paste games I can think of off the top of my head, was smart enough to switch up the classes game to game. 
The hub, most of the characters, all of it. It's all the same. 
They definitely saved a lot of money doing this but I'm just wondering where the fuck it all went. 

The community is mostly awful. It's full of people who will rage at you for your lack of knowledge, racist homophobes, and all the like. The first game had this problem too, maybe it's because I'm like 7 years older, but I swear the first one wasn't this bad. 

The whole ""the game is Free!"" motto is clearly just a way to bait you into buying the DLC. Unless you want access to less weapons, raids, cosmetics, and everything in between.

The game is extremely imbalanced. From the classes to the weapons this game lacks balance in anyway. 
It's basically a drunk toddler if it was game code. 
This is what I meant when I said people will disagree with me on class diversity, most people just to play the most powerful Sub-class and (sub-sub-class?) that the game has to offer. 

At the end of the day, I get the vibe Bungi just wants my money, and as a result of that they have to keep making this game better. Not the other way around, as in Bungi wants a good game, and as a result of that they get money. It's another soulless game trying to suck all the cash it can from people pockets, feeding off the addicting game loop and forcing DLC to continue the never-ending grind. 

So you're probably wondering.

Why am I recommending this game. 

It's simple really.

",this game is appropriately titled it is a second destiny there are now two of them but i enjoyed the first one and so far this one is showing to be just as fun and frustrating i played countless hours of destiny on xbox one in high school but i was sceptical coming into destiny two as i heard things from friends like it s literally just the first game again and it s like the devs went backwards but it went on sale i know it s free but lets be real these games aren t shit without dlc and i grabbed it about a week ago now i ve got a lot to say the fun stuff gun make big bang and brain go brrr the gun play is great from the weapon design to the sounds design it s all amazing visuals are also quite nice and the game runs smoothly on my ancient pos i call a gaming pc i m a huge fan of any games with collecting aspects so that gets a plus from me as there is a stupid range of weapons and gear to hunt down great class diversity some might disagree with me on this and i know why but more on that later great enemy diversity bosses don t have way too much fucking health anymore mmorpg and fps blend together really well for me i really enjoy this genre i m sure there is a name for it i just don t care pvp and pve options for whatever way you want to play the game althogh pve does have some issues the new pvevp game mode gambit is really fun the execution was on point with that one they plan to support the game til next year with expansions still to come y know if you want to give more money to bungi the dlc s are actually pretty good a lot more customisation than the first game ripping around in those drifty little star wars cars is fun as fuck now that i ve covered most of what i like about the game the frustrating to start off what i mentioned at the start this game is undeniably just a copy paste of the first game for the most part the starting area is the same i was genuinely shocked when i took control of my character for the first time i one hundred percent was convinced i accidentally launched destiny which i don t even own on pc it was baffling to me that you would start a sequel to a game with the exact same first level imagine you just bought your first copy of halo two you put the game into your xbox and suddenly you feel a strange sense of familiarity as a you are awoken from a cryo pod and have to go find captain keyes again i think even a eleven year old would go what the fuck i did this already the only reason bungi could ve done this was to save money it bothers me even two0 hours of gameplay later the classes are the same for the most part i guess theres more sub classes or whatever but fuck that they shoulda added a fourth class to the game even the borderlands series one of the most copy paste games i can think of off the top of my head was smart enough to switch up the classes game to game the hub most of the characters all of it it s all the same they definitely saved a lot of money doing this but i m just wondering where the fuck it all went the community is mostly awful it s full of people who will rage at you for your lack of knowledge racist homophobes and all the like the first game had this problem too maybe it s because i m like seven years older but i swear the first one wasn t this bad the whole the game is free motto is clearly just a way to bait you into buying the dlc unless you want access to less weapons raids cosmetics and everything in between the game is extremely imbalanced from the classes to the weapons this game lacks balance in anyway it s basically a drunk toddler if it was game code this is what i meant when i said people will disagree with me on class diversity most people just to play the most powerful sub class and sub sub class that the game has to offer at the end of the day i get the vibe bungi just wants my money and as a result of that they have to keep making this game better not the other way around as in bungi wants a good game and as a result of that they get money it s another soulless game trying to suck all the cash it can from people pockets feeding off the addicting game loop and forcing dlc to continue the never ending grind so you re probably wondering why am i recommending this game it s simple really gun go bang brain go,game appropriately titled enjoyed showing fun frustrating played countless hours xbox school sceptical

15201,18,Fri,Jun,2021,21:28:45,Borderlands 3,"TLDR: Typical Borderlands punny funness rendered virtually unplayable by a garbage quest tracking system and general UI suckiness.

If you've played the other Borderlands then you get the gist of this one. It's cleverly dumb and stupidly funny, all mean in a very positive way! The guns are always a blast to find and the actual game play is absurdly fun. I'm not much of a gamer but I've enjoyed the entire Borderlands suite.

Why the negative review, then? The following reasons:

1) The UI for this game absolutely ruins it. Half the time you're playing it you're in the in-game menu trying to find something. Because you can only track one quest at a time and only that quest's objectives are displayed on the minimap and menu map, to find different quests' objectives near each other you have to go to the quest page, select a quest, go to the menu map, look where the objectives are, go back to the quest page, select another quest, go back to the menu map and so forth and so on. Mind you, none of shortcut keys work while in the in-game menu so you have to mouse over everything... I've read on the internet ""You can quickly flip through quests with the press of a button!"" For the computer, it's '[' and ']' and I've never seen such a useless feature in a game. All it does is make little quest objectives jump around the edges of your mini map. That was as tedious to write as it is to use the quest tracking system.

2) The guns are awesome but at some point there are too many of them. The sorting is nice but let me sort by value so I can drop the ones that will sell for the least (you always end up dropping a ton because you never know how many objectives you'll have to complete to finish a mission).",tldr typical borderlands punny funness rendered virtually unplayable by a garbage quest tracking system and general ui suckiness if you ve played the other borderlands then you get the gist of this one it s cleverly dumb and stupidly funny all mean in a very positive way the guns are always a blast to find and the actual game play is absurdly fun i m not much of a gamer but i ve enjoyed the entire borderlands suite why the negative review then the following reasons one the ui for this game absolutely ruins it half the time you re playing it you re in the in game menu trying to find something because you can only track one quest at a time and only that quest s objectives are displayed on the minimap and menu map to find different quests objectives near each other you have to go to the quest page select a quest go to the menu map look where the objectives are go back to the quest page select another quest go back to the menu map and so forth and so on mind you none of shortcut keys work while in the in game menu so you have to mouse over everything i ve read on the internet you can quickly flip through quests with the press of a button for the computer it s and and i ve never seen such a useless feature in a game all it does is make little quest objectives jump around the edges of your mini map that was as tedious to write as it is to use the quest tracking system two the guns are awesome but at some point there are too many of them the sorting is nice but let me sort by value so i can drop the ones that will sell for the least you always end up dropping a ton because you never know how many objectives you ll have to complete to finish a mission,tldr typical borderlands punny funness rendered virtually unplayable garbage quest tracking system general ui suckiness played borderlands cleverly dumb stupidly funny positive guns blast find actual game play absurdly fun gamer enjoyed entire borderlands suite negative review reasons ui game absolutely ruins half time playing game menu find track quest time quest objectives displayed minimap menu map find quests objectives quest select quest menu map objectives quest select quest menu map mind shortcut work game menu mouse internet quickly flip quests press computer useless feature game make quest objectives jump edges mini map tedious write quest tracking system guns awesome point sorting nice sort drop end dropping ton objectives complete finish mission,tldr typical borderlands punny funness rendered virtually unplayable garbage quest tracking system general ui suckiness played borderlands cleverly dumb stupidly funny positive guns blast find actual game play absurdly fun gamer enjoyed entire borderlands suite negative review reasons ui game absolutely ruins half time playing game menu find track quest time quest objectives displayed minimap menu map find quests objectives quest select quest menu map objectives quest select quest menu map mind shortcut work game menu mouse internet quickly flip quests press computer useless feature game make quest objectives jump edges mini map tedious write quest tracking system guns awesome point sorting nice sort drop end dropping ton objectives complete finish mission,0,2,0.515306115,7,9,-0.12,0.53,1671,333.0,0.11,133.24,333.0,36,112,1.43,5,5.02,112,-0.8065,3

Great and believable story. 
Good value for money even if not on sale.
World tier auto leveling up is a must if you like a challenge. 
There are many comparisions that can be drawn with Borderlands. In gameplay, stages, and mechanics. Nothing wrong with that if you liked borderlands.
Typical Unreal environment and graphics. Nothing special, but not horrible or underwhelming either.

For EA and most there is nearly NO micro transactions. 2. the single player Is perfect adds a new thing to each mission it's always fresh for about 5 - 7 hours which is impressive. 3. The game is is bad ass to the fucking Extreme, the executions, the mechanics, to the jetpacks, to the Titans, Everything I love to a most likely unhealthy degree. *PS This game could cause self dead thoughts after finishing the single player*. 4. There is 
co-op, and guess what? IT'S Fucking Lit, If it's to easy You can make it harder, and vis versa. 5. The weapons are great they all feel well balanced (More then most games) SMG's are good if You're fast paced, Or You can use a DMR for sniping And Run'n & gun'n, 6. You would think that Titans The Father of gods Would be near unkillable and Unfair right? Wrong they handled this So well, anti-titan guns are good against Titans I.E. The Name Anti-titan, But You can still play as titans even though there are Very strong anti-Titan guns that can 1Shot them, they have the same principal as titans
Slow Big and fatal, Slow for the gun is takes a wind up before hand for most and have long travel time just like the titans weapons. 7. You can be a Bad ass and take batteries off of Titans and taking the batteries will either put them in what I call Boom state which means they can not be healed back up to not Boom state  *from my knowledge* but the Titans have elec clouds that will hurt You if You're to close or on it's back trying to put a battery in it They also get notified when you are on them, and Pilots Principal is Fast Small less fatal. 8. And the game between man vs/and machine is So well balanced cause even though the mechs are able to stomp You to death without even knowing that They had done it, And 1 shot You It's still So well balanced and I commend Them for that. 9. The ability to change your tactical (which is a ability) weapons titans pilots anti-Titan guns, The normal weapons have to mod slots to unlock where you can add mods that are reload fast or bigger mag, these mods are quite basic which is kinda likable but a little more complexity to the mods couldn't hurt. All around this game makes You feel like a unkillable badass god with a Titan or a fast and agile pilot by parkour'n around the map and going into a house and leaving a side with a Titan shooting forward and stealing It's battery and then running off with speed. This game is just perfect and should be bigger then any Call of duty or battlefield. If You like fast paced FPS's with You running around And running away from a certain death and up close battles with the other pilots that sat there titans down to play outside, this game is for You and You Need to try it if You never have before.

It was released in 2016 and has since gained a reputation for its fast-paced action, impressive graphics, and innovative gameplay mechanics.

The storyline of Titanfall 2 is a well-crafted narrative that follows the journey of a pilot named Jack Cooper and his Titan, BT-7274. The game takes place in a distant future where humans have colonized other planets and are engaged in a war between two factions: the Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation (IMC) and the Frontier Militia. As Jack Cooper, players must fight their way through a variety of different missions and environments, each with their own unique challenges and objectives.

One of the standout features of Titanfall 2 is its wall-running mechanics. Players can run, jump, and slide along walls to navigate the game's levels in ways that are both exhilarating and strategic. Wall-running adds a new level of depth and complexity to the game's movement system, allowing players to chain together movements in a way that feels natural and fluid.

The game's titular Titans are also a major highlight. These towering mechs are powerful weapons that players can call in to help them in battle. Each Titan has its own unique set of weapons, abilities, and playstyle, allowing players to customize their loadouts to suit their preferred playstyle. The ability to pilot and control these Titans is an exciting and satisfying experience that adds another layer of depth to the game's combat.

Overall, Titanfall 2 is an outstanding first-person shooter that is well worth playing for anyone who enjoys fast-paced action and innovative gameplay mechanics.

I am thoroughly impressed with how Bungie was able to revive this game as well as they have. 

My only complaints are the sun-setting of content (meaning they locked away the old content like y1 and y2 content), a lot of the fun activities are locked behind a pay wall (even stuff from 2-3 years ago) and the fact that new players have a ""tutorial"" quest but they don't know or learn anything in the process. I have tried to get friends into this game/franchise and they are too lost or overwhelmed to play on their own or want to play at all.

It has less than 60 fps no real tutorial it feels like a free game i paid 40 bucks for i feel ripped off by reviewers who said it was great after the wastelanders update they are super wrong, there is nothing great about it. the only thing that sucks is the open world is really cool because West Virginia is a great setting but doesn't save this train wreck that bethesda clearly knew better than to make. It is not world of warcraft it's not destiny and according to most people the only thing that remotely makes this fallout is power armor. Oh and starfield has 1000 planets cause todd howard couldn't overpromise enough with 1 planet, bethesda is clearly dying they wont be able to compete in future years and this game was the beginning of a flaming trainwreck. This set in motion a series of horrible events (remember deathloop?) that wont change THIS GAME RUINED THEM.

This is so sad for me they didnt have to do anything all they had to do was make it playable modders can and have done this better MODDERS you know the people who arent gifted multi million dollar budgets. This is a crap game made by devs that either are sellouts who no longer care or they didnt have a choice either way.

38968,22,Sun,Jan,2023,00:23:37,Elden Ring,"Elden Ring is a complete disaster and I'm NEVER listening to any gamer reviewers ever again.  This game is a solid 5 out of 10, and that's me being generous.  

Now before you say: ""git gud!""  I am good.  I'm better than you.  I've beaten all three Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, and Mortal Shell.  And I did it with pure melee builds, no ranged combat, and no cheese tactics.  

Elden Ring is very simply nothing more than an expansion pack for the original Dark Souls game.  It's a very pretty world, with a very dull story, and absolutely abysmal combat.  The combat system is a copy and paste from Dark Souls with a mediocre horse combat mechanic and a terrible jump attack slapped onto things.  

It's 2023 and the combat mechanics just feel so old, outdated, slow, unresponsive, and disconnected.  The combat destroys all of the immersion of the game turning what should be a realistic combat game into a boring and highly redundant strategy game.  It's not about fighting in Elden Ring, it's about memorizing your opponents moves, rolling around all of them, and then getting in a single light attack before rolling around some more.  

Bosses are terribly optimized and all of the fights are the same.  The boss attacks you nonstop giving you occasional opportunities for a light attack.  All of the special abilities, spells, and more advanced combat techniques are almost always useless against most bosses.  

Hit boxes are an unmitigated disaster and your character feels like the size of a 1983 Cadillac El Dorado.  Mobs will track you even after there is no way they could possibly hit you, and they score a direct hit, even rotating (as if on ice skates) 180 degrees to land a successful attack.   You can rarely if ever go on the offensive in Elden Ring and you just simply are stuck waiting for enemies to finish their endless string of fast attacks while you wait for an opportunity to land a single light attack.  It's a complete and utter snoozefest.  

Now, if you want to try some Soulsborne combat that actually feels realistic, fresh, and modern, go play Mortal Shell which came out a couple of years ago and was designed by less than 15 people.  In Mortal Shell I actually feel connected to my character and I feel like I'm actually fighting in a realistic way and not doing silly nonsense like in the Devil May Cry titles.  

For a game as big as Elden Ring, and for FromSoftware to copy and paste the combat from Dark Souls 1 which is a 13 year old title now, it's simply obscene that game reviewers were giving Elden Ring a 10 out of 10.  

I'll finish Elden Ring because I spent a fortune on it, but it's boring me to death.  And I will never pay full price for a FromSoftware title again.  If you're going to make video games you need to evolve and get better.  Not reskin games from nearly 20 years ago.  

Stay mad Dark Souls fanbois.  I care not for your flaccid bluster and endless seething.  

tldr: turn 360 degrees and walk away from Elden Ring.  Gamers got too invested in this title and almost no one is being honest about how spectacularly mediocre Elden Ring really is.",elden ring is a complete disaster and i m never listening to any gamer

If anyone has ever enjoyed GTA: San Andreas Online, they will understand what this game is.

It's okay. It can get boring and grindy at times. The story has just enough there to keep you pushing through, though you don't expect any payoff. The inventory management is atrocious. The lag is super annoying sometimes.

But it's still multiplayer fallout. Something we've been asking for for ages. It's not great, but if you're looking for something to waste some time with friends, you could do far worse.

67142,20,Thu,May,2021,06:17:58,Outriders,"There are many, many people pointing out the big bugs that plague the game, but that's just the start.

Build diversity is very low in this game.  In order to do well on any expeditions past a certain tier, you NEED to build DPS with your bullet augmentation available to your class (if you do.  Devastator can solo content fine but good luck staying in a lobby in multiplayer).

And while many praise the story, I never really liked it to begin with.  

Spoilers from here on, don't read if you don't want to be spoiled.  I will occasionally skip over parts, but at this point I couldn't really be bothered to fill it in more.

The game's story operates on a very interesting sci-fi trope.  Earth is being devastated with so much horrendous natural disasters that the world governments decided to put all their efforts into finding an earth-like planet to inhabit.  They do find the planet for this (Enoch), and while they were going to send two ships to the planet, one's engine was blown to pieces due to an accident while it was being built, so the other ship was the only one that left.  83 years later, humanity arrives at the planet and all seems well as the Outriders start setting up to let the rest of the frozen colonists set up a city...  up until your group of Outriders find out that something has gone wrong in those years of travel and now the planet has an Anomaly that defies all known laws of reality.  While escaping from it, you are hit by the Anomaly's lightning and survive despite a few other members of your group getting annihilated when struck, and you continue on.  Despite your best efforts to stop the ship from sending down the rest of the frozen colonists, they are launched and you're put into a cryo pod so that you can be looked at later.  30 years later, you are awoken from your stasis to a hellscape of an endless war.

You come to find out that what's left of humanity is fighting over what resources are left, as the only technology left after the Anomaly rolls through is analog equivalents or lower in tech and there are too many humans for the resources left.  Throughout the story, you're trying to find the signal you found before the initial contact with the Anomaly 30 years ago and you travel through ever more treacherous landscapes to do so.  You find out that the planet was already inhabited before humans came here, however whatever's left of their civilization is abandoned.  On top of this, the only native that you find comes along with you, but further into the story becomes one of the enemies you fight when they tried to save your group as well as her friend.  As it turns out, whatever happened to them caused them to become the savages you fight, giving them increased strength but making them lose any rational thought.

Much, much later on, you come to find out that there was a much more advanced race here once.  You then come to find out that these were humans, and they had arrived before your ship did, enslaving the natives before killing them once they found out about the pillars they worshipped, or so it seemed.  This is where the sci-fi trope comes into play; these humans were the ones that were left behind on Earth after your ship departed, and rather than be consigned to their fate, they formed a dictatorship and focused all of their efforts on developing better technology and improving the husk of the ship whose engine was blown to pieces before it was finished.  Because of this, they advanced their technology beyond yours and arrived first, and then f***ed up the planet before you arrived.  The signal you were tracing was the SOS the captain of the ship sent out, who had been alive all these years somehow, and never even regretted having set into motion the likely end of humanity.  Upon finding this out, you kill the captain and then send the signal to your ship to jettison the resources that were still left up there, and the endgame is all about finding these pods and getting the resources within.

While I never really read much into sci-fi, the particular trope used in the story is a very interesting one.  However, it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth as I never really could find the ability to care about any of them apart from the native you find and Jakub, who I knew was going to eventually die once you find his daughter that he seemingly didn't care for on the surface.  On top of this, while a dark ending isn't typically bad, the premise laid out by the game posits that humanity is entirely doomed, and that the supplies dropped from the ship only merely lengthens the lifespan of humanity.  I may be gleaning from it incorrectly, but that was how I saw the ending.  Humanity likely won't be able to leave the planet until they figure out how to work the pillars that the natives once did, and the only native you ever found sacrificed themselves.

This coupled with all of the massive problems the game still has, I can't recommend it whatsoever.  Even if they end up releasing free DLC updates, they'd have to rework quite a lot of the game in order to make it enjoyable.",there are many many people pointing out the big bugs that plague the game

79118,6,Tue,Apr,2021,20:49:03,Outriders,"So myself and 2 friends decided to play this. We did 90% of all side quests and completed campaign and also done some expiditions. After completing game these are my thoughts.

Graphics and lighting are some of the best ive ever seen and towards the end of the game they seem to get even better. The artist that done the armour needs a raise! - However the entire testing team needs to be sacked. More on this later....

The general gameplay loop is travel to next set area, kill mobs, move onto next area. This is thinly disguised between walking to next area or a cutscene. This however sounds bad but its a fun gameplay loop. This is certainly not open world gameplay. It does remind me on gears of war gameplay where you get to a large room , kill all and move on.

Overall the campaign was fun and the chars were very engaging. The Russian guy being my fav char. Char models and voice acting are especially good although near the end of the game myself and friends were more focusing on the weelchair girl and how she was getting to such insane places with no wheelchair access.

Guns graphics are stunning and the overall loot system is very well done and it leave you always not totally satisfied with what you have and always wanting a little more equipment.

This game is totally ruined by the crashing, the server disconnects, the invisible spawning, the random disconnects.... I can go on but in the end the bugs totally ruined my game experience and I would estimate out of the 70 hours I have played this game at least 10 hours is reloading or recovering from crashing or 3 player spawn bugs. 10 fucking hours in unacceptale. Either I would crash or get bugged or one of my mates would. It almost become unbearable towards the end and I just wanted it over. And to top it off we finally got to the credits and we had to push esc and even that was bugged. By then we lost the will to live and just accepted it.

I just cant understand how a 5 years in development game can be release with such easily found bugs in it. Maybe they need to employ some proper testers instead of blind chimps.

Why do we allow games companies to sell us bugged and unplayable games. If I bought a toaster and it toasted bread 1/2 the time and the other 1/2 would just either burn bread to a cinder or just not toast at all I would be taking that toaster back, no matter the time I owned it.

Enjoyable game but not worth the buy if you want to waste literally hours resetting pc and loading the game over and over.",so myself and two friends decided to play this we did ninety percent of all

the seventy hours i have played this game at least ten hours is reloading or recovering from crashing or three player spawn bugs ten fucking hours in unacceptale either i would crash or get bugged or one of my mates would it almost become unbearable towards the end and i just wanted it over and to top it off we finally got to the credits and we had to push esc and even that was bugged by then we lost the will to live and just accepted it i just cant understand how a five years in development game can be release with such easily found bugs in it maybe they need to employ some proper testers instead of blind chimps why do we allow games companies to sell us bugged and unplayable games if i bought a toaster and it toasted bread one two the time and the other one two would just either burn bread to a cinder or just not toast at all i would be taking that toaster back no matter the time i owned it enjoyable game but not worth the buy if you want to waste literally hours resetting pc and

That is where this game is very strong. The story for this game is a roller coaster, it starts pretty mediocrely, then goes to its height, and then back down to its lowest point. The ending is so bad I'm surprised this came from a AAA company. Even battlefield campaign has a better story than this game and it is sad to see. There were many bugs on release that seemed to be fixed, seems like People Can Fly still cares about this game, but there are still more bugs that I encountered after not playing the game for 2 months. The Multiplayer is somewhat good. It's cool that you can play with friends on other consoles when on PC, love games that do that and I got to give props to where it's due. Unfortunately, this game's multiplayer is super laggy, sometimes bullets from enemies don't even exist, and sometimes you will get shot through walls if you are not hosting. The game is also super laggy when you are not the host. After you beat the story, you will be able to play destiny like nightfalls but with the previous missions. Beating all 15 of the missions will allow you to do a final boss fight, which is the same boss you fight when you beat the game just in a different area with different powers. When this game was announced I was hoping it wouldn't be an Anthem clone but unfortunately, it was. I would say give this game a try when it's on sale for $25. There are still side missions and extras but I don't feel encouraged to

sadly, no. maybe get it on sale for 12 bucks, play the story and call it good. it's a disgrace to the franchise and seemingly the end. no real risk or reward, no real meta or end game. arbitrary limits to currencies (you can hold 40k caps, that's it) and stash weight. the game is overtly casual, with multiple time gates with ridiculously low limits. many basic UI/UX errors, in game inconsistencies and oversights. best shit in the game is either legacy or injected/hacked. the real end game becomes buying trading and selling of top tier goods for in game and real world money. niche group of tryhards can be found pvping from time to time at a common meeting ground. that's the only place you'll find people who care about meta and actually tryin to min-max. sadly most of the casual players aren't too social, and almost no one gets immersed in their game enough to not kill your own immersion when they begin speaking. the poor attempt at proximity chat doesn't help either though. the game says it's co-op but only in the slightest. you can play together, but cannot progress together. little to no need for teamwork in any of the events as they seem to be made to be completed by a single player. the atom shop is over priced, granted you can get somethin like ~1200atom from each free season. idk

Mind you; a lot of the complaints I have wouldn't matter/probably exist if this game had followed the usual fallout format. it's mostly the stuff that makes it ""76"" that ruins it. if they had just made a 1-4 man co-op fallout shit woulda been way different.",if this is your first fallout get it on sale and enjoy it if you plan on playin for a month get one month of fallout onest and cancel it fill up your junk box with everything you get along your journey quit reading here anyone else sadly no maybe get it on sale for one2 bucks play the story and call it good it s a disgrace to the franchise and seemingly the end no real risk or reward no real meta or end game arbitrary limits to currencies you can hold four0k caps that s it and stash weight the game is overtly casual with multiple time gates with ridiculously low limits many basic ui ux errors in game inconsistencies and oversights best shit in the game is either legacy or injected hacked the real end game becomes buying trading and selling of top tier goods for in game and real world money niche group of tryhards can be found pvping from time to time at a common meeting ground that s the only place you ll find people who care about meta and actually tryin to min max sadly most of the casual players aren t too social and almost no one gets immersed in their game enough to not kill your own immersion when they begin speaking the poor attempt at proximity chat doesn t help either though the game says it s co op but only in the slightest you can play together but cannot progress together little to no need for teamwork in any of the events as they seem to be made to be completed by a single player the atom shop is over priced granted you can get somethin like one200atom from each free season idk mind you a lot of the complaints i have wouldn t matter probably exist if this game had followed the usual fallout format it s mostly the stuff that makes it seventy six that ruins it if they had just made a one four man co op fallout shit woulda been way different,fallout enjoy plan playin fallout onest cancel fill junk journey quit reading sadly one2 bucks play disgrace franchise seemingly end risk reward end game arbitrary limits currencies hold four0k caps stash weight game overtly casual multiple time ridiculously limits basic ui ux errors game inconsistencies oversights shit game legacy injected hacked end game buying trading selling top tier goods game world niche group tryhards found pvping time time common meeting ground find people care tryin sadly casual players social immersed game kill immersion begin speaking poor attempt proximity chat game op slightest play progress teamwork events made completed single atom shop priced granted somethin one200atom idk mind lot complaints matter exist game usual fallout format stuff makes ruins made op fallout shit woulda,fallout enjoy plan playin fallout onest cancel fill junk journey quit reading sadly one2 bucks play disgrace franchise seemingly end risk reward end game arbitrary limits currencies hold four0k caps stash weight game overtly casual multiple time ridiculously limits basic ui ux errors game inconsistencies oversights shit game legacy injected hacked end game buying trading selling top tier goods game world niche group tryhards found pvping time time common meeting ground find people care tryin sadly casual players social immersed game kill immersion begin speaking poor attempt proximity chat game op slightest play progress teamwork events made completed single atom shop priced granted somethin one200atom idk mind lot complaints matter exist game usual fallout format stuff makes ruins made op fallout shit woulda,0,2,0.523809552,4,22,-0.69,0.87,1781,347.0,0.08,138.83,347.0,28,123,1.39,1,5.13,123,0.739,2

The beginning is very rough, and there are some major problems, but I'm a major fan of Looter Shooters and I absolutely fucking love this game. 

+The loot system is where the game really shines. The guns and armors can come with crazy mods on them, and you can apply those mods to other pieces of loot, even ones from legendaries. You can create crazy combos that really synergize well together. 
+The power fantasy of the game is amazing, as you can continue to progress even after hitting max level (30) by getting weapons of higher level with each world tier and Challenge tier (up to lvl 50 loot). The skills and trees of each class are very fun and powerful, with room to improve them through mods and other stats on armor/weapon pieces. 
+The game has plenty of content and is not live service, so theres no need to wait a month or so for a new update to spend 30 minutes playing something new before having to wait another month. The campaigns, side quests, and endgame expeditions are all very fun to play and while they may seem repetitive, the constant new loot, leveling up, increasing world tiers, and changing level designs will encourage you to switch your play styles and try new things. 
+The world and challenge tiers are amazing progression systems. The higher the tier, the more loot drops, the higher quality and level loot you get, and the harder the enemies become. They do a very good job finding the perfect balance of buffing enemies stats and having higher enemy density, without leaning too much towards one another.
+The interrupt system with bosses and elites is a very cool system aswell, with the ability to stop them from performing an attack with the interrupt effect on certain skills. 
+Communication with the dev team have been superb.
=If you enjoy B-movies from channels like SYFY, you'll love the story. If you don't, you'll hate it.
=I haven't really encountered very many bugs.  I was going to write about a few bugs I experienced, but when i woke up this morning, they had already been patched.
-Sound design is not that great. There were some moments where I wanted to rip my ears out, and others where It felt like someone had put their big ole mommy milkers in them. 
-The cover system is pretty trash, but most of the classes have a run and gun design to them, so there's really no need for them. It's mostly for the enemies tbh.
-The enemies DON'T MISS, and it's very frustrating being frozen or set on fire every two seconds because the enemies have the aim of Mcree's High Noon 24/7
-Servers have been rocky, and will likely improve over time, but as of RIGHT NOW, holy shit... I haven't been disconnected but once or twice, but i've really solo up until the endgame activities. I know of some people who have been disconnected WAY too many times. Playing co-op has also been a disaster as the rubber-banding and lag have just made horrible. There currently is no offline only mode. 

It's not the supposed ""DeStInY kIlLeR"" that people were screeching about. It was never meant to be the destiny killer, just like none of the other games peoples screeched about were meant to be. It's a fun, pay upfront and get all the content, game. Something the looter shooter genre definitely needed. I'm glad to finally have a game that I can play through, enjoy, and put down when if feel finished instead of having this constant sense of dread that I'm missing out. I recommend buying it if you are a hardcore fan of the genre and are looking for a fresh experience.

about a few bugs i experienced but when i woke up this morning they had already been patched sound design is not that great there were some moments where i wanted to rip my ears out and others where it felt like someone had put their big ole mommy milkers in them the cover system is pretty trash but most of the classes have a run and gun design to them so there s really no need for them it s mostly for the enemies tbh the enemies don t miss and it s very frustrating being frozen or set on fire every two seconds because the enemies have the aim of mcree s high noon twenty four seven servers have been rocky and will likely improve over time but as of right now holy shit i haven t been disconnected but once or twice but i ve really solo up until the endgame activities i know of some people who have been disconnected way too many times playing co op has also been a disaster as the rubber banding and lag have just made horrible there currently is no offline only mode it s not the supposed destiny killer that people were screeching about it was never meant to be the destiny killer just like none of the other games peoples screeched about were meant to be it s a fun pay upfront and get all the content game something the looter shooter genre definitely needed i m glad to finally have a game that i can play through enjoy and put down when if feel finished instead of having this constant sense of dread that i m missing out i recommend buying it if you are a hardcore fan of the genre and are looking for a fresh experience if you re not so familiar with looter

Fun gameplay, combat, leveling and gearing process, including some fun set bonuses.  

Terrible stability, always online, no offline single player and the worst Peer-to-Peer multiplayer connection I've experienced in a long time. 

Launched with server issues. Matchmaking connectivity is abysmal, making co-op unplayable 90% of the time and unacceptable at this point. Matchmake and you just lag/skip around, abilities don't go off, you get stuck in animations, get kicked mid-expedition and lose all your loot, or worse, complete the whole expedition and then get disconnected and still lose your loot + more time, etc. 

Example of abilities not working in Co-Op: 
-Weapon Mods that refill your ammo on kill don't always trigger when killing enemies. 

-Pyromancers Heatwave (firewall) will play the animation but the skill won't go off. I don't know if this is a problem with the game losing track of the cooldown timer or just generally buggy. 

-Devastator using Gravity Leap and getting stuck upon landing. 

-Trickster getting stuck if you take damage as you activate the Whirlwind Blade skill.(and more) 

 Crashes aren't rare. 

A handful of enemies are way out of balance and instead of being difficult, are just annoying. Snipers having insta-lock aim, the Alpha Perforos jump spamming without a cooldown to stagger-lock you, the Crawlers spamming multi-directional attacks in all directions without you being able to dodge them, also staggering you on hit and the Brood Mothers laying a blue flame DOT puddle on the ground that you can't see. 

Players that got their inventories wiped are still waiting on getting them restored (as of 4/26/2021) 

The first patch consisted of nerfs.

I find this very relatable. I've been playing since year 1 of Destiny 1 and I've almost always enjoyed the game. Maybe it's nostalgia, maybe it was my low standards as a kid. Now, the game feels different which can be good, but not for me. With D2's current f2p model, and even since year 1 of D2, every expansion pack has been way more than it's worth, only exception being Forsaken. Now, people who see a cool exotic and want to get it, must get past a paywall for Seasons. Want to get the Fourth Horseman because it's making a comeback in the second game? pay $10 and THEN go grind for it. And Bungie is still charging $40 for half-assed DLCs with a tiny amount of story progression. Trust me I really want to like this game, and I have for many years, but in its current model, I don't have the free time nor money to even play the game and enjoy new content. As a person who also bought D2 with the expansion pass, I feel that my already spent money is not worth anything because now people can get what I bought for $100 for free, and I STILL have to pay for seasons if I wanna stay up to date and obtain new guns. So yes, I hate destiny, but it's no longer my favorite game.",i hate destiny it s my favorite game i find this very relatable i ve been playing since year one of destiny one and i ve almost always enjoyed the game maybe it s nostalgia maybe it was my low standards as a kid now the game feels different which can be good but not for me with d2 s current f2p model and even since year one of d2 every expansion pack has been way more than it s worth only exception being forsaken now people who see a cool exotic and want to get it must get past a paywall for seasons want to get the fourth horseman because it s making a comeback in the second game pay dollar one0 and then go grind for it and bungie is still charging dollar forty for half assed dlcs with a tiny amount of story progression trust me i really want to like this game and i have for many years but in its current model i don t have the free time nor money to even play the game and enjoy new content as a person who also bought d2 with the expansion pass i feel that my already spent money is not worth anything because now people can get what i bought for dollar one00 for free and i still have to pay for seasons if i wanna stay up to date and obtain new guns so yes i hate destiny but it s no longer my favorite game,hate favorite game find relatable playing enjoyed game nostalgia standards kid game feels d2 current f2p model d2 expansion exception forsaken people exotic past paywall seasons horseman making comeback game pay one0 grind bungie charging half assed dlcs amount progression trust game years current model time play game enjoy content bought d2 expansion feel spent people bought one00 pay seasons stay obtain guns hate longer favorite game,hate favorite game find relatable playing enjoyed game nostalgia standards kid game feels d2 current f2p model d2 expansion exception forsaken people exotic past paywall seasons horseman making comeback game pay one0 grind bungie charging half assed dlcs amount progression trust game years current model time play game enjoy content bought d2 expansion feel spent people bought one00 pay seasons stay obtain guns hate longer favorite game,0,0,0.0,5,4,0.11,0.3,1222,252.0,0.08,100.83,252.0,21,67,1.37,16,4.85,67,0.9797,2

I think many people enjoy the parkour abilities in the game, tho Iâm not a big fan of wall running as I see it less of a scifi thing but more of a fantasy thing that doesnât really fit into a universe with large fighting bipedal machines.

Recommended to buy when in discount.  The game came out in 2016 so I suppose itâs not outrageous when multiplayer is completely offline: it stuck at âsearching for serverâ and could never connect to anything.  Overall, Titanfall is a solid futuristic singleplayer FPS game that manages to weave both the human and the machine perspectives into a complete and satisfying experience.

While science fiction like Destiny, this game is a third person coverish shooter like The Division. This is an in your face action packed game. You must play aggressively to heal and survive. 

The story is pretty good and the voice acting is decent. I enjoyed the story and side quests. The game can be very challenging as a solo player with maxing the tier (difficulty scaling) system, but playing co-op things get much smoother. The game is linear in design which was a disappointment but it still offers a good experience. Each of the four classes plays differently due to the heavy reliance on your abilities, much more so than in games like Destiny where abilities are slower to build and use and weapons have a heavy reliance. In Observers, you'll be using your abilities steadily with a high reliance than weapons.  I plan on leveling up all four classes because I enjoy this so much. 

The game had a rocky release I missed due to Covid19, but the worst of the bugs have been fixed while I was out of commission. Some bugs remain, such as the game crashing on start-up, HDR is broken, and cross-play not being recommended at the moment due to other bugs still not worked out. While I love this game, it is priced a tad high for what it is. It should have been priced at $39 to $49 USD.

The  only real down side is the stash limit. They artificially  limit how much stuff you can store to aggravate you into buying  fallout 1st sub. Unlike POE which is a  FTP game and  is a one time charge, Bethesda wants you to continually pay for stash space for ever. GTFOH...  The alternative is to  just keep what you need and go out and forage  when you need more stuff. That's a big ask for the type of game it is. I've been playing about a week and it's still fun. I'm not sure how long I'm going to stay though. The stash limit is a starting to be a real PIA to deal with. 

A good tip is to upgrade all the carrying capacity cards. I know a lot of youtubers say getting other perks first, for the ""best builds"", but they have fallout 1st and weight limits aren't a issue.

1102,30,Thu,Mar,2023,02:30:51,Borderlands 3,"Overall, it is a great game. I do not regret playing it. And I think it is slightly better than Borderlands 2 - mainly because I didn't care for a plot quality. Please get me right, I enjoy the lore. I was playing to shoot, loot and relax. And the game is soooo good in this aspects.

This game IS NOT for you If you want great storytelling.
This game IS for you If you want Borderlands 2 with gameplay improvements, new missions and lore extension.

What have been improved since Borderlands 2:
- teleporting to the travel stations from any point
- removed slug and added cryo weapons
- much more loot
- graphics and sound
- juicy worlds
- extended world's lore

What I disliked:
- main story line is just OK, not great, not bad.
- I can't name any character in the game with 50% charisma as Handsome Jack's.
- sometimes missions was deliberately dragged out. For example, NPCs will slowly tell you what to do and only then you can move to the next location.
- DO NOT START DLCs BEFORE MAIN STORY IS FINISHED. I think there should have been a disclaimer. They appeared in the middle of the story line in the Sanctuary and I foolishly finished them all before main story line. The only problem was low level enemies for the rest of the main story line. I was like lvl50 and enemies was lvl25. There was no mechanism to adjust main story missions to your the current level.",overall it is a great game i do not regret playing it and i think it is slightly better than borderlands two mainly because i didn t care for a plot quality please get me right i enjoy the lore i was playing to shoot loot and relax and the game is soooo good in this aspects this game is not for you if you want great storytelling this game is for you if you want borderlands two with gameplay improvements new missions and lore extension what have been improved since borderlands two teleporting to the travel stations from any point removed slug and added cryo weapons much more loot graphics and sound juicy worlds extended world s lore what i disliked main story line is just ok not great not bad i can t name any character in the game with fifty percent charisma as handsome jack s sometimes missions was deliberately dragged out for example npcs will slowly tell you what to do and only then you can move to the next location do not start dlcs before main story is finished i think there should have been a disclaimer they appeared in the middle of the story line in the sanctuary and i foolishly finished them all before main story line the only problem was low level enemies for the rest of the main story line i was like lvlfifty and enemies was lvltwo5 there was no mechanism to adjust main story missions to your the current level,great game regret playing slightly borderlands care plot quality enjoy playing shoot loot relax game soooo aspects game great storytelling game borderlands gameplay improvements missions extension improved borderlands teleporting travel stations point removed slug added cryo weapons loot graphics sound juicy worlds extended world disliked line great bad character game percent charisma handsome missions deliberately dragged npcs slowly move location start dlcs finished disclaimer appeared middle line sanctuary foolishly finished line problem level enemies rest line lvlfifty enemies lvltwo5 mechanism adjust missions current level,great game regret playing slightly borderlands care plot quality enjoy playing shoot loot relax game soooo aspects game great storytelling game borderlands gameplay improvements missions extension improved borderlands teleporting travel stations point removed slug added cryo weapons loot graphics sound juicy worlds extended world disliked line great bad character game percent charisma handsome missions deliberately dragged npcs slowly move location start dlcs finished disclaimer appeared middle line sanctuary foolishly finished line problem level enemies rest line lvlfifty enemies lvltwo5 mechanism adjust missions current level,1,1,0.516351521,8,13,-0.24,0.7,1341,250.0,0.13,100.05,250.0,33,84,1.46,10,5.36,84,0.9978,0

63827,25,Thu,Nov,2021,07:04:34,Outriders,"This used to be a positive review.  I enjoyed the story and the gameplay of the base game enough to put up with the many bugs and, frankly, incompetent game design choices.  I think most of those have been covered in other reviews, but I'd like to list four 'favorites' from the base game, that continue into the World Slayer DLC.

The first is the fact that, most of the time (when using keyboard), one set of keys is used to accept or reject various dialogues - however, in certain instances two completely different keys are used for no discernible reason.  How this made it past QA before the initial release is astonishing.  How it is still in the game two DLCs later is, to quote The Princess Bride, inconceivable.

The second is the scourge of unskipable cut scenes.  This has been a consistent complaint from gamers for at least 2 decades (no exaggeration).  The fact that any dev would include unskipable cut scenes in any modern game is a sad comment on the state of 'modern' game development.

The third problem is with self-reviving.  If you're playing with other players you can revive yourself once without the need for the intervention of one of the other players.  In single player, if you go down you're done and have to restart the expedition from the very beginning (or, in Tarya Gratar, you can at least restart the stage instead of the entire expedition) - no self-revive at all.  This is like a big middle finger to people who either choose to play solo, or can't find others to play with because of the game's low player count.

The fourth problem is the requirement for total consensus to proceed in certain situations.  For example, after finishing the DLC there is a credit roll (or a blank screen if I try to skip the credit roll, which I'll get to).  The credit roll can be skipped if ALL of the players vote to skip, and only if ALL the players vote to skip.  If 2 out of 3 vote to skip, too bad - those 2 players are held hostage to the 3rd player's whims - and when I vote to skip, but other players do not, I get a black screen - so I can't even pass the time by reading the credits.  And if you don't want to sit through the credit roll, there is only one way to get around it - ALT-F4 (OK, there are two other ways - task manager and similar utils, and any kill commands that might be available natively or via 3rd party utils for killing processes using a CLI).  Compounding this baffling UI design choice, since you probably won't want to sit through the credits more than once (if you enjoy the DLC enough to play more than once) and force quit the game, the final stage will be logged as a failure, not a success...not because you didn't successfully finish the DLC, but because you didn't sit through the credits.  Apparently the devs are starved for recognition - maybe they could make a game without all the bad design choices and then they might actually get some of the recognition they are so clearly desperate to receive.

As I said, these are just a few examples of the utterly mystifying design choices that still exist in the game (among others that still exist, and one that was actually corrected with the free New Horizon DLC).

I still play the game and enjoy many of the mechanics, but had I known how the game was going to ultimately turn out I probably would have at least waited for a sale.

I try to be patient with, and supportive of, software developers like PCF, but with all the inconsistent UI issues and nonsensical design choices, this comes off as such a low effort product that I can't offer my recommendation at anything approaching the amount they are asking for at the time of this writing.  I'm not saying *don't* buy it - I'm saying that if you really want it, make your choice with a clear understanding of what it is you're getting...and wait for a sale.",this used to be a positive

It really shows you how much of a cash grab this game was, and how they really didn't put any time at all into this. I got this game for $10, and I still feel like I got ripped off. I'm not lying when I say this, but this game should be free at this point. It is so horrible, that the max server I could ever find myself on, was with a max of 3 other people besides me on the whole map. What an absolute flop of a game.

The Trading is the worst i have ever seen in multiplayer game, caps mean nothing 40k caps limit is like sandwich your mother used to give u to school 
There are 20 main armor legendary effects 2 are usable 3 if u are into pvp 
if u would want to craft yourself an armor set with 3 specific legendary effects it would take u like 10 years 
Almost everybody is running low health builds and there is no point in using any other build (besides pvp)
why does these options even exist in the first place 
Unyielding Power Armor and appeal are still in the game despite Legacy removal update
There are people trading/selling unobtainable dev room plans some of them are just skins but u can come across people selling nuka paddle balls for 20k or even Enclave Plasma Rifles with unobtainable mods (Forceful stock), they can place every mod on this gun they can craft EPR with Aligned automatic barrel and Reflex sight and sell it for ~40k easy, u could waste hours just server hopping to find one while someone can just craft it for free, these people can even craft 3* scrip guns for free  
Did u know that mobs should drop armor and guns depending on if u have learned plan for it or not ?
Me neither BECAUSE IT DID NOT WORK AS INTENDED FOR 4 YEARS
Years old issues are not taken care of and devs just add f****** re rollres for yor dayli quests and skins so u 
could waste your money. EAgames on low settings
there should be an option to pick all 3 legendary effects on an item for like 10-50k scrip 
or there should be either no limit for caps trades or insanely high limit so u could actually buy something useful for caps
keep in mind that im not even scratching the ""performance"" / ""optimization"" side of this game",the hole legendary item system is awful getting certain items with specific roll is impossible most of the time the trading is the worst i have ever seen in multiplayer game caps mean nothing four0k caps limit is like sandwich your mother used to give u to school there are twenty main armor legendary effects two are usable three if u are into pvp if u would want to craft yourself an armor set with three specific legendary effects it would take u like ten years almost everybody is running low health builds and there is no point in using any other build besides pvp why does these options even exist in the first place unyielding power armor and appeal are still in the game despite legacy removal update there are people trading selling unobtainable dev room plans some of them are just skins but u can come across people selling nuka paddle balls for twentyk or even enclave plasma rifles with unobtainable mods forceful stock they can place every mod on this gun they can craft epr with aligned automatic barrel and reflex sight and sell it for four0k easy u could waste hours just server hopping to find one while someone can just craft it for free these people can even craft three scrip guns for free did u know that mobs should drop armor and guns depending on if u have learned plan for it or not me neither because it did not work as intended for four years years old issues are not taken care of and devs just add f re rollres for yor dayli quests and skins so u could waste your money eagames on low settings there should be an option to pick all three legendary effects on an item for like ten 50k scrip or there should be either no limit for caps trades or insanely high limit so u could actually buy something useful for caps keep in mind that im not even scratching the performance optimization side of this game,hole legendary item system awful items specific impossible time trading worst multiplayer game caps four0k caps limit sandwich mother give school armor legendary effects usable pvp armor set specific legendary effects years running health builds point build pvp options exist unyielding armor appeal game legacy removal update people trading selling unobtainable dev room plans skins people selling nuka paddle balls twentyk enclave plasma rifles unobtainable mods forceful mod gun epr aligned automatic barrel reflex sight four0k easy waste hours server hopping find people scrip guns mobs drop armor guns depending learned plan work intended years years issues care devs add rollres yor dayli quests skins waste eagames settings option pick legendary effects item 50k scrip limit caps trades insanely limit buy caps mind im scratching performance optimization side game,hole legendary item system awful items specific impossible time trading worst multiplayer game caps four0k caps limit sandwich mother give school armor legendary effects usable pvp armor set specific legendary effects years running health builds point build pvp options exist unyielding armor appeal game legacy removal update people trading selling unobtainable dev room plans skins people selling nuka paddle balls twentyk enclave plasma rifles unobtainable mods forceful mod gun epr aligned automatic barrel reflex sight four0k easy waste hours server hopping find people scrip guns mobs drop armor guns depending learned plan work intended years years issues care devs add rollres yor dayli quests skins waste eagames settings option pick legendary effects item 50k scrip limit caps trades insanely limit buy caps mind im scratching performance optimization side game,0,2,0.497925341,8,12,-0.2,0.67,1831,339.0,0.1,135.64,339.0,34,129,1.5,1,5.4,129,0.9636,2

43338,21,Fri,Oct,2022,22:51:25,Fallout 76,"Save yourself the headache and Do Not Buy This game!! It's more stressful to play than it is fun. 

Too start off, The menus are trash to work with and not very user friendly but this is still not the worst of it. 
Understand that this a survival game and most likely the worst one you will ever play. 
Like other survival games, You have to manage your water & food. In this game you have to manage all that too. Water, Food, Radiation your health and even storage. 

One of the worst features of the game, is you never have enough storage and they want you to buy the Fallout 76 monthly membership called 1st. Which wont give you much to help you progress. You get something called a scrap box where you can store unlimited amount of scrap. As soon as your monthly subscription ends. Your stuck back with your limited storage, however you can pull scrap from the scrap box but cannot put stuff into it unless you have that membership. The membership don't really give you anything to progress though the game. 
Your stuck with lousy skins or decor for your camp. Pretty much all you get is the cosmetic items.

So you don't have a membership and your storage is full. You think you can sell your stuff off right?
 All the venders in the game also have a limited storage and limited amount of caps they can give you. SADLY.... ALL THE VENDERS are connected. Meaning you sold as much as you could to the one vender and you cannot sell your items at another vender because they all share storage and caps. So you basically you can only sell so much every 24 hours. 

You can really only do so much before your storage is full and you can't sell off your stuff. You can farm but only places once every 24 hrs. 

That's not all, This wilderness is brutal. The AI is horrible, You will get the enemy down in health just so it will glitch out and all of a sudden the enemy has full health. Half the time your guns will not shoot and reloading takes forever. Your now dead and really there is no penalty to that other then going back to get your stuff, You cannot loot everything. It is not a shared loot system so any player can come up and take anything your collecting including your dropped goods when you die which is only scrap. 

The menus and game play are just horrible all around. Sometimes your will have your equipment wheel pop up randomly. 
I've had glitches and bugs in missions where I cannot complete 100% of the game. 
You guns sometimes don't fire. Sometimes you cannot reload. Sometimes you have to mash a button more than once just to heal. 
It horrible, I cannot believe how bad this game is. 

One last thing I had to deal with. When you start this game you need a bethesda acct. all my information is the same as my steam acct and elder scrolls online acct. So I never got to chose a unique name in game for Fallout 76 and when I contacted support they said they could fix the problem but I would lose all my progress and my account in Elder Scrolls Online. Bethesda is complete TRASH!

Old mechanics/Gameplay.

1. FFYL (Fight For Your Life). Mechanic is good overall. But why you automatically does not stand up if noone in the vicinity? You can easily survive being horded by multiple elite/boss enemies, but you will not survive if you kneeled by lone barrel, you have accidentally shot.

2. Looting... it was ok, for older BL1 and more or less for BL2. But it is very old and boring mechanic now. Instead of stupid farming players must be concentrated on having fun with favorite weapon. Not to spend couple of hours just to farm desirable weapon, but with wrong modifier/element/etc. My suggestion: weapon crafting system. Found a weapon. Player should be able to upgrade weapon with money/resources. Player should be able to change elements/modifiers. Players should be able to improve rarity of weapons with rare material, e.g. increasing modifiers slots, increasing stats, changing elements. Each weapon type could have pool of modifiers applicable to other types. Legendary weapon could have unique effect/modifier/game changer, but still should be upgradable/modifiable.
You see, instead of stupidly farming you can have fun and feeling how you moving toward you goals. Compare this: you farming few hours to get weapon with 1 out of 3 desired modifiers. Instead of roaming, killing various bosses to gather rare material, finding modifier 1, 2, 3, so you can later attached them. Latter gameplay has more feeling of progression. Without upgrade weapon mechanic, any weapon become ineffective quickly once you progress. 

3.  Give ability to turn on/off enemies level scaling. For f.. sake, when you are 5+ levels above enemies it ruins all fun: loot is underleveled, enemies are weak, and you almost do not feel any progression thus game quickly bores you. What is the reason why players cannot reach max level at first playthrough? Returning to pandora at level 30-40 to see level 1, really? Also difficulty: for first playthrough only easy and normal. WTF? I want hard enemies, tough situation right from start but expecting respectively better loot, faster progression. BTW, BL2 was far much more difficult and enjoyable for the first playthrough. This game if for casuals, and I hate it.

4. Story was never strong part of the series. But BL3 story feels super lazy written. You feel angry why character, you love and play for in BL1 & BL2 become so weak and make so many unrational decisions. This could continue forever... but again, BL is about gameplay. Not about story.

5. Melee. My personal pain. Never try it. Never believe what they say: skill trees, melee class, blah blah blah...
In core, there wouldn't be any problems, if there were no melee mechanics at all, because game is (unfortunately, despite many good aspects) looter-shooter (starts hating this combination of words). First of all no dedicated melee weapon (blades, knifes, etc.). Only gun attachments. Hate this since BL2. 
Again. Melee does not make sense and cannot compete with gunplay. Distance: you cannot reach flying enemies. How to be pure melee character if you downed (FFYL)? It is a few times longer (comparing to regular shooting) to run toward every enemy and punch them in the face. There is no melee characters in BL3. Amara? No. Melee character must be in its majority be fined by own SKILLS, not by class mods (DLC muse/breaker), artifacts(static charge/while elephant/etc.), weapons (psycho stabber) or modifiers. Because otherwise it is not vault hunter as character who can be badass on its own, it is an artifacts and mods and weapons who are badass. And you... empty shell.
Yes melee can deal billions of damage, but damage comes not from you, but from you items. Why I should invest so many point in melee, when it is not viable. BL2 - Zero, BL3 - Amara. Both are disappointing, even though Zero much more fun to play with (invisible, quick distance shortening with sword dash, chain, near fly, quick hits).
Melee is slow. You literally staring at you enemies for nearly a second between punches with blittz.  Why can't you punch quickly, like wild brute (as quick at least as Brick during action skill in BL1), why there are some unnecessary cooldowns for blittz and other skills, having that even with no cooldown melee sucks. Come on, you have 6 huge arms. Regular hand attacks as remote/close upward/downward attacks, flying jab, 360 spins... only in your dreams. 
You might say, for distance use phaseflare. But it stucks in almost every object/texture/tight gap. Why even adding collision for it?
Also, the award for the most stupid gameplay decision ever made comes to a game designers who added in the game guns that fires gut shots that deal... melee damage (face-puncher). 
So my advice to developers, either make it competable or remove it altogether from you games. 
Me personal decision - never EVER try melee in BL games.

Verdict: 6/10. Only for gun shooting. Never ever even think of trying a melee.",visually game is awesome rhys atlas hq s office is something a lot of visually stunning views good ui elements appearance of characters and guns at top level but unfortunately these are subjectively only positive things in a game old mechanics gameplay one ffyl fight for your life mechanic is good overall but why you automatically does not stand up if noone in the vicinity you can easily survive being horded by multiple elite boss enemies but you will not survive if you kneeled by lone barrel you have accidentally shot two looting it was ok for older blone and more or less for bltwo but it is very old and boring mechanic now instead of stupid farming players must be concentrated on having fun with favorite weapon not to spend couple of hours just to farm desirable weapon but with wrong modifier element etc my suggestion weapon crafting system found a weapon player should be able to upgrade weapon with money resources player should be able to change elements modifiers players should be able to improve rarity of weapons with rare material e g increasing modifiers slots increasing stats changing elements each weapon type could have pool of modifiers applicable to other types legendary weapon could have unique effect modifier game changer but still should be upgradable modifiable you see instead of stupidly farming you can have fun and feeling how you moving toward you goals compare this you farming few hours to get weapon with one out of three desired modifiers instead of roaming killing various bosses to gather rare material finding modifier one two three so you can later attached them latter gameplay has more feeling of progression without upgrade weapon mechanic any weapon become ineffective quickly once you progress three give ability to turn on off enemies level scaling for f sake when you are five levels above enemies it ruins all fun loot is underleveled enemies are weak and you almost do not feel any progression thus game quickly bores you what is the reason why players cannot reach max level at first playthrough returning to pandora at level three0 forty to see level one really also difficulty

""I am a 50 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game.
I am a single father for my son who is now 14 years old. My son has recently started playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
In less than a week, he has already played more than 20 hours.
It was terrible for me, because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son.
because he was always with his friends or watching YouTube videos.
So I decided to create a Steam account to play with my son. I started playing but it was my first time playing a video game since the 90s so I was pretty lost. I asked my son for help and we spent several hours together playing this game.
I liked it as it was the best time I have had with my son since my wife died.

Right now I'd estimate if you don't burn yourself out and stick to moderate playtime you can get a month or two out of this game with the current content, or anywhere from 80 to 300 hours depending on how perfect you want your end-game gear to be.

Certain build archetype's need more gear investment then others as well as Tier III mods which is what you'll spend a big chunk of your time working for in endgame. People Who Can fly seem to be willing to commit the time to this games post launch support, it is yet to be determined which route they will take however. Nerfs so far have been their solution so that may not be for you in a PvE looter shooter.

Bugs and issues surrounding online aspects of the game are pretty notorious right now, however I myself have yet to experience them in a meaningful manner. Avoiding co-op at this time as well as making sure your internet connection is stable seem to be enough to avoid for example the dreaded inventory wipe. Because of the auto saving feature only kicking in at specific moments in gameplay or when entering/exiting UI duping is possible, but for the most part is insignificant as there is no trading and capping out your endgame resources is only a matter of time even playing without using these bugs.

So far my experience has been worth the 60 dollars I spent. I look forward to the DLC as I anticipate it has the potential to double the content in the game if done correctly. Also looking forward to optimizations surrounding bugs as well as bringing up non meta builds to be less janky.(I tried double turret Technomancer and let me say it's far inferior to meta)

7.2/10",the core game is enjoyable it runs well on my now somewhat dated hardware dlc has potential to really unlock the game right now i d estimate if you don t burn yourself out and stick to moderate playtime you can get a month or two out of this game with the current content or anywhere from eighty to three hundred hours depending on how perfect you want your end game gear to be certain build archetype s need more gear investment then others as well as tier iii mods which is what you ll spend a big chunk of your time working for in endgame people who can fly seem to be willing to commit the time to this games post launch support it is yet to be determined which route they will take however nerfs so far have been their solution so that may not be for you in a pve looter shooter bugs and issues surrounding online aspects of the game are pretty notorious right now however i myself have yet to experience them in a meaningful manner avoiding co op at this time as well as making sure your internet connection is stable seem to be enough to avoid for example the dreaded inventory wipe because of the auto saving feature only kicking in at specific moments in gameplay or when entering exiting ui duping is possible but for the most part is insignificant as there is no trading and capping out your endgame resources is only a matter of time even playing without using these bugs so far my experience has been worth the sixty dollars i spent i look forward to the dlc as i anticipate it has the potential to double the content in the game if done correctly also looking forward to optimizations surrounding bugs as well as bringing up non meta builds to be less janky i tried double turret technomancer and let me say it s far inferior to meta seven two ten,game enjoyable runs dated hardware dlc potential unlock game estimate burn stick moderate playtime game current content hours depending perfect end game gear build archetype gear investment tier mods spend big chunk time working endgame people fly commit time games launch support determined route nerfs solution pve looter shooter bugs issues surrounding online aspects game pretty notorious experience meaningful manner avoiding op time making internet connection stable avoid dreaded inventory wipe auto saving feature kicking specific moments gameplay entering exiting ui duping part insignificant trading capping endgame resources matter time playing bugs experience dollars spent forward dlc anticipate potential double content game correctly forward optimizations surrounding bugs bringing builds janky double turret technomancer inferior,game enjoyable runs dated hardware dlc potential unlock game estimate burn stick moderate playtime game current content hours depending perfect end game gear build archetype gear investment tier mods spend big chunk time working endgame people fly commit time games launch support determined route nerfs solution pve looter shooter bugs issues surrounding online aspects game pretty notorious experience meaningful manner avoiding op time making internet connection stable avoid dreaded inventory wipe auto saving feature kicking specific moments gameplay entering exiting ui duping part insignificant trading capping endgame resources matter time playing bugs experience dollars spent forward dlc anticipate potential double content game correctly forward optimizations surrounding bugs bringing builds janky double turret technomancer inferior,1,0,0.0,7,8,-0.07,0.5,1761,332.0,0.14,132.86,332.0,45,114,1.5,8,5.3,114,0.9636,0

Game has so many issues, feels cheap as fuck, and plays like it is still in alpha. 

I don't understand how shit like this gets past QA and being allowed to be released on to the public. 

But your So called ""Ambassadors"" will suck this game off because they got given a free copy of the game to play earlier so they obviously won't talk facts about it. Because they do not want to get taken off the ""Ambassador program"" Gotta milk that garbage YT content AMIRITE?!

So Lets talk about issues shall we? 

Server Issues

Game first launched, practically no one was able to play the game due to its terrible server issues.. of course that has been resolved now well at-least for the majority. There still are people having issues signing it and connecting to the game but hey waddaya know it's okay you just gotta put in more effort to connect to the game such as delete your cache or disabling crossplay..

Inventory Wipe Bug:

You better be careful and not get too invested in the grind. Because you will loose all you worked hard to gain. 
This game has managed to bring back the Inventory wipe bug for the second time. Aka all that loot you farmed for all those precious legendaries you managed to finess from the game by exploiting those quests and if you did do it the legit way then it doesnt matter if you are one of those unfortuanate people you will loose all your items and your character will be stripped down leaving you butt naked all because you decided to wanted to go online and play with other random people to attempt as being a sociable person and make new friends. 

Constant crashes

This game has the tendancy to crash whenever it pleases all whilst leaving you with hefty big crash log files. But you wouldn't know that until you noticed your SSD/HDD space getting smaller and smaller leaving you to think ""how the fuck am I loosing all this storage?!""

and of course there are plenty of more bugs but I am not going to go too deep into them. Google is your friend. 

Now lets talk about the games performance shall we? 

I'll keep it short and simple. 

Garbage, non-optimized game. I play on 9900K, 2080TI and 32GB DDR4 3000mhz and this game manages to drop from 250+ FPS down to 60 hardlocking it's self until I either tab out the game or press esc just so that my FPS goes back up to the 250s. Funny how they haven't bothered fixing that issue yet. 

but hey InStalL NeW DRiVeRSSS

The GAMEPLAY

This game feels cheap as fuck. Plays like it's still in Alpha. Gun play feels cheap, the guns feel like plastic toys, the character animations and movement feel basic as fuck and CLUNKY. 

The Cover to Cover system is garbage and is practically USELESS in this game anyway when you find your self having to BACK track your self into the area before you just left due to the horde of enemies who decide to spam you with grenades the first 10 seconds you take cover and then decide to rush you including their mini bosses with leaves you with no option but to run the fuck back just so you can create some DISTANCE. But even then those USAIN BOLTS who chase you with their daggers that seem to gather like a pack of hyenas manage to chase you down causing you to roll fire one bullet spam abilities roll back fire again. Jesus if I wanted to kit so much I would go and play League of Legends. 

Your weapons you gain become useless pretty fast regardless on if you level them up to the standard level to match the World Tier. At this point you're just equipping anything that looks good and actually does decent amount of damage but again don't get too comfortable with your weapons because it only takes a few levels for them to be completely dog shit. Oh and not to mention that the droprates for legendaries are absolutely DOG SHIT. 

The enemies also have AIMBOT SNIPERS which is hella annoying. The stagger effective in this game is also really fucking annoying. Your recovery time to anything is slow as fuck. so you end up just getting combo to fuck if you're not careful. 

Oh forgot to also mention that developers like to nerf builds instead of fixing actual game so hey don't bother getting to comfortable with your builds either. 

In conclusion: Game is garbage, needs a lot of work and improvements, shit plays like it's still in Alpha and don't listen to these so called Ambassadors who claim the game is perfect just because they got a free copy of the game. The game is bland, and unsatisfying. But here I am still playing it with 41 hours in because I like to step in shit from time to time. 

If you got a craving for looter shooters or Looting games where you build up your characters to make em stronger etc. 

Go play Warframe, Division/Division 2, Borderlands, and Destiny 2, Diablo, and Path of Exile 

Because.. 

This game just ain't it chief.

it is a good game , but i don't think its worth 55 dollars despite being a 24 hours worth of gameplay (if you don't do side quests)

as i said i tried very hard to like this game and this is one of my first not recommended reviews
even giving it at least a week or two but it seems things are getting from bad to worst
after being 49 hours in enduring through 


crashes at every attempt to do something (ranging from connecting to game - final moments before claiming the resource pods in expedition)
inventory wipes 
poor multiplayer support
enemies phasing through walls 


(no character deletion so far) Positive ?

59559,3,Fri,Jul,2020,18:16:53,Fallout 76,"Fallout 76 is an odd duck. We all have seen, and heard the reputation the game has rightfully earned since a disasterous launch over a year ago. A launch so bad, due in part to the fact Bethesda didn't expect Fallout fans to want Fallout in their Fallout game, rather than just doing standard PVP stuff within a post apocolyptic backdrop.

In an attempt to salvage the flaming dumpster Bethesda overhauled the game with the introduction of NPC characters, skill checks, and new quest lines. Is it enough? In my opinion yes, but with the caveat that you have to be a fan of the franchise.

I originally played the beta of the game pre-launch on the PS4. At the time the game had clipping issues, enemies who just stand in place while you shoot them, T-posed enemies, and a vast host of other bugs and glitches. Since grabbing the Steam version and playing for roughly 51 hours as of the time of this writing I have shockingly run into very few bugs.

I had an escort mission where the Mr. Handy I was following seemingly vanished after a fight, but that could be hand waved away as him just going a direction I could spot him in. I've had a few minor instances where an enemy seems stuck in the floor and you can't hit him or vice versa - but honestly this is a common problem for almost any MMO styled game. For the most part the game has run reasonably well and I've not run into any issues.

There is HOWEVER one major issue I have run into. On rare instances (this has happened twice in 51 hours) you will enter a terminal only to discover your inputs are no longer working and you can't back out of the terminal forcing you to force close the game via task manager and reopen it.

Still, this has happened so seldomly that I can't completely bury the game for it. The gunplay is about the same as you'll find in Fallout 4, with the downside of VATS now attempts to function in real time via slowing down time ... which doesn't work because it's happening in real time so basically your targeting chance goes from 95% to 0% in a split second and it's generally more of a hassle than it's worth to bother with. It is, however, effective for spying enemies from a large distance to make you aware they exist.

If you like the Fallout series, with a primary focus on the Bethesda era games chances are you'll probably enjoy this now that we have quests, factions, and all the like added. It's not as elaborate as the big brother single player games but if you can get the game cheap enough you'll have fun. If the Fallout series does nothing for you, then I'm not sure this game is going to change that.

So I recommend the game, but I do so with the caveat that perhaps it's best to wait for a good sale.",fallout seventy six is an odd duck we all have seen and heard the reputation the game has

So I want to start with the Pro's and the only pro at the moment, the combat is honestly so much fun however combat only lasts so long

Cons (excluding anything related to bugs/network issues)

As a huge D3 player and a big fan of other looter shooters on steam, Outriders absolutely fails in the endgame department which is the main reason for a negative review (subject to change)

Combat only is enjoyable for so long, once you clear T15 that's pretty much it, nothing more, no increasing challenging difficulty, no greater than that loot T15 is your goal which granted class might take longer. No leaderboards to try decrease times. So unless you have a personal agenda to get it done faster there is no reason.

The only other replayability comes in making more classes which is also dealt with poorly in comparison to other games the only option you have is just to replay the whole entire story again, with side quests (to get better WT so you can transition easily to Expeditions) instead of just letting you farm Expeditions for xp its just rinse and repeat which honestly is a bit of a drag (considering some cutscenes are just completely unskipable

There also seems to be a big issue in comparison to others when it comes to party size and scaling.. where most games increase quantity (not all) of mobs, increasing damage and health. I am not to sure how to word it exactly but honestly feels like some classes weren't play tested enough to be viable at higher levels speaking mainly for the devastator the only supposed ""tank"" class which can't keep agro as it has abysmal damage so unless you playing a technomancer that can clear T15 in a breeze

I don't think its end all for the game, just need to see a good roadmap and see where the game is going but there is definite room to make it really successful",decided to take my time on this review and i honestly was quite on the fence as i wanted to post a review based on more on gameplay and design decisions in comparison to other online offline looter shooters as they are on of my preferred game types on steam so i want to start with the pro s and the only pro at the moment the combat is honestly so much fun however combat only lasts so long cons excluding anything related to bugs network issues as a huge d3 player and a big fan of other looter shooters on steam outriders absolutely fails in the endgame department which is the main reason for a negative review subject to change combat only is enjoyable for so long once you clear t15 that s pretty much it nothing more no increasing challenging difficulty no greater than that loot t15 is your goal which granted class might take longer no leaderboards to try decrease times so unless you have a personal agenda to get it done faster there is no reason the only other replayability comes in making more classes which is also dealt with poorly in comparison to other games the only option you have is just to replay the whole entire story again with side quests to get better wt so you can transition easily to expeditions instead of just letting you farm expeditions for xp its just rinse and repeat which honestly is a bit of a drag considering some cutscenes are just completely unskipable there also seems to be a big issue in comparison to others when it comes to party size and scaling where most games increase quantity not all of mobs increasing damage and health i am not to sure how to word it exactly but honestly feels like some classes weren t play tested enough to be viable at higher levels speaking mainly for the devastator the only supposed tank class which can t keep agro as it has abysmal damage so unless you playing a technomancer that can clear t15 in a breeze i don t think its end all for the game just need to see a good roadmap and see where the game is going but there is definite room to make it really successful,decided time review honestly fence wanted review based gameplay design decisions comparison online offline looter shooters preferred game types steam start pro pro moment combat honestly fun combat lasts cons excluding related bugs network issues huge d3 big fan looter shooters steam outriders absolutely fails endgame department reason negative review subject change combat enjoyable clear t15 pretty increasing challenging difficulty greater loot t15 goal granted class longer leaderboards decrease times personal agenda faster reason replayability making classes dealt poorly comparison games option replay entire side quests wt transition easily expeditions letting farm expeditions xp rinse repeat honestly bit drag cutscenes completely unskipable big issue comparison party size scaling games increase quantity mobs increasing damage health honestly feels classes play tested viable higher levels speaking devastator supposed tank class agro abysmal damage playing technomancer clear t15 breeze end game roadmap game definite room make successful,decided time review honestly fence wanted review based gameplay design decisions comparison online offline looter shooters preferred game types steam start pro pro moment combat honestly fun combat lasts cons excluding related bugs network issues huge d3 big fan looter shooters steam outriders absolutely fails endgame department reason negative review subject change combat enjoyable clear t15 pretty increasing challenging difficulty greater loot t15 goal granted class longer leaderboards decrease times personal agenda faster reason replayability making classes dealt poorly comparison games option replay entire side quests wt transition easily expeditions letting farm expeditions xp rinse repeat honestly bit drag cutscenes completely unskipable big issue comparison party size scaling games increase quantity mobs increasing damage health honestly feels classes play tested viable higher levels speaking devastator supposed tank class agro abysmal damage playing technomancer clear t15 breeze end game roadmap game definite room make successful,0,1,0.523809552,8,15,-0.3,0.77,2047,383.0,0.14,153.26,383.0,52,144,1.54,7,5.34,144,0.9955,0

Anything that was interesting about the game is lost in a sea of bad connectivity, constant gamebreaking bugs, and character assassination for the sake of campaigns riddled with plot holes and seasonal stories that nobody bothered to write.

I am physically disgusted and disappointed by how truly terrible the game is, and how much time and energy and MONEY I've put into it hoping all the potential ever went anywhere.

Bungie does. Not. Care.
They will milk you for every red cent because they know they can drop 4 HALF FINISHED story missions FOR A WHOLE SEASON and break the game so bad it cant be played twice a week and everyone who's played for years will just accept it and keep paying because they're in too deep to back out.

Pros:
-Almost fun sometimes

Cons:
-7 broken developer promises a week.
-Riddled with Hackers
-Inaccessible
-Content removed constantly. No linear path. No direction for new players.
-Severe connectivity issues (developer refuses to move to dedicated servers)
-Nerfs and buffs dolled out based on player *USAGE* not *PERFORMANCE*
-Developer ignores game-breaking bugs and fixes any exploits that allow players to avoid wasting 50hrs a week grinding.
-Blatant lack of regard for player experience

That's not even mentioning they've nerfed a lot of things, which wouldn't be bad if a lot of skills and mods don't work properly. Some of the class skill nodes don't work at all!

You can see by the hours I've put into it (279 as of this review). It really feels like a fallout game now. Not quite as polished storywise but it does have coop which is fun. My favorite part has always been wandering around and finding new things so this fits really well.

However, one thing makes me not recommend it especially with the new patch. The new patch increased level scaling for all enemies while also lowering all damage (modifiers are additive instead of multiplicative). This really isn't a big deal. But what is a big deal is.....

HACKED WEAPONS. They are EVERYWHERE and people use them constantly. You'll see 5+ people, all level 400+ using hacked weapons to one shot endgame bosses, regular mobs, really anything. It completely ruins everything especially since you can't get loot if you don't tag mobs or do enough damage to them. Given the high level of these players, it means they've been playing for a long time and also means Bethesda has done nothing about it.

So the end result is it's just not worth it unless you like playing games like the early 00's when there was no anti-cheat at all.

Waiting 5 seconds for every interaction I have in the world to actually register on screen,  whether it's picking up an item or opening a door.

Waiting as I try over and over to interact with a terminal that is required to proceed in a main quest. The animation to bend down at the terminal happens, then nothing happens and the ""use"" button becomes active again.

Waiting as I fire bullet after bullet into an enemy, hoping that my hits will eventually register before it manages to kill me first. My bullet hits may not register immediately, but boy does it's hits on me register just fine. Oh and that's if the enemy is actually visible at all.

Waiting on a never-ending loading screen after I naively thought I'd try to enter an indoor location (like The Wayward) or fast travel, wondering if I'll just have to force close the game and call it a night from the mounting frustration.

Trying to use a workbench when all this is going on? Forget it. You will instead be greeted by a ""waiting for response from server"" message.

This is what you can expect for a big chunk of the time you spend in this game because the servers are constantly having issues. You might have a couple days in a row where the servers you're on are great and the game will be a lot of fun during those times, but all I can say is I'm glad I bought this game when it was heavily discounted.",although i have really enjoyed the game during the stretches when it s been playable i can t in good conscience recommend this game to anybody over the rougly eighty hours i ve played too much of it has been spent waiting waiting five seconds for every interaction i have in the world to actually register on screen whether it s picking up an item or opening a door waiting as i try over and over to interact with a terminal that is required to proceed in a main quest the animation to bend down at the terminal happens then nothing happens and the use button becomes active again waiting as i fire bullet after bullet into an enemy hoping that my hits will eventually register before it manages to kill me first my bullet hits may not register immediately but boy does it s hits on me register just fine oh and that s if the enemy is actually visible at all waiting on a never ending loading screen after i naively thought i d try to enter an indoor location like the wayward or fast travel wondering if i ll just have to force close the game and call it a night from the mounting frustration trying to use a workbench when all this is going on forget it you will instead be greeted by a waiting for response from server message this is what you can expect for a big chunk of the time you spend in this game because the servers are constantly having issues you might have a couple days in a row where the servers you re on are great and the game will be a lot of fun during those times but all i can say is i m glad i bought this game when it was heavily discounted,enjoyed game stretches playable conscience recommend game rougly hours played spent waiting waiting seconds interaction world screen picking item opening door waiting interact terminal required proceed quest animation bend terminal active waiting fire bullet bullet enemy hoping hits eventually manages kill bullet hits immediately boy hits enemy visible waiting ending loading screen naively thought enter indoor location wayward travel wondering force game night mounting frustration workbench forget greeted waiting response server message expect big chunk time spend game servers constantly issues couple days row servers great game lot fun times glad bought game heavily discounted,enjoyed game stretches playable conscience recommend game rougly hours played spent waiting waiting seconds interaction world screen picking item opening door waiting interact terminal required proceed quest animation bend terminal active waiting fire bullet bullet enemy hoping hits eventually manages kill bullet hits immediately boy hits enemy visible waiting ending loading screen naively thought enter indoor location wayward travel wondering force game night mounting frustration workbench forget greeted waiting response server message expect big chunk time spend game servers constantly issues couple days row servers great game lot fun times glad bought game heavily discounted,0,1,0.0,5,7,-0.17,0.4,1566,305.0,0.12,122.05,305.0,36,95,1.46,14,5.13,95,-0.8668,2

18023,6,Sat,Mar,2021,03:44:07,Borderlands 3,"Amazing gameplay, the best in the series, but it's split between a garbage fire of a story. The villains were seemingly intentionally made to be as annoying as possible while doing a ""PaRoDy Of StReAmInG aNd InTeRnEt CuLtUrE."" Ava is ludicrously annoying and gets shoved into the spotlight for the whole story. The only new character that I actually ended up liking, [spoiler]Typhon DeLeon[/spoiler], is only introduced in the last quarter of the game and dies by the end of it. The story is filled with constant voicelines talking your ear off with jokes that never land when all you want to do is shoot bad guys in peace. 

All that said, the gunplay and character skills provide the most freedom of gameplay in the series. Each character has at least 3 ways to play and all of them are interesting. Side quests, while still having the noxious stink of the main story being rubbed off on it, are pretty high-quality and actually have decent humor sometimes.
While overall I like the game, I'm still going to refrain from recommending it as the story is an important element of Borderlands games at this point, and the story in this one is one of the most tedious and annoying stories I've ever played in a game.

Unlike previous Fallout games this one is a MMO so you'll be playing alongside other players but the majority of the game can be played by yourself with a some events benefiting from being in teams. Crafting makes a return but instead of settlements you now build a camp but also weapons and armour that can be crafted or scrapped for components and recipes. Food, beverages, meds and chems can also be crafted with the correct perks and recipes. 

The most noticeable difference is your character now has a thirst/hunger gauge, equipment wears out and breaks, catch diseases/mutations, ammo weight and dealing with a stash limit so you have to balance your scavenging with what you need. Levelling up is also different with perk cards so you can tailor your character to your play style but still have the option to change them as required. 

There is microtransactions with the first being the paid currency Atoms. These can be earned in game but at a slower rate and the other is a subscription that provides unlimited stash for materials/ammo and extra cosmetic items. The game can still be played without these with little to no problem. 

Probably wait until a sale but it's fun to play with a lot of issues thankfully ironed out.",what started off as a rather empty game with random disconnections repeatedly crashing during certain missions no npc s and events that bugged out fallout seventy six has eventually turned out to be a good game unlike previous fallout games this one is a mmo so you ll be playing alongside other players but the majority of the game can be played by yourself with a some events benefiting from being in teams crafting makes a return but instead of settlements you now build a camp but also weapons and armour that can be crafted or scrapped for components and recipes food beverages meds and chems can also be crafted with the correct perks and recipes the most noticeable difference is your character now has a thirst hunger gauge equipment wears out and breaks catch diseases mutations ammo weight and dealing with a stash limit so you have to balance your scavenging with what you need levelling up is also different with perk cards so you can tailor your character to your play style but still have the option to change them as required there is microtransactions with the first being the paid currency atoms these can be earned in game but at a slower rate and the other is a subscription that provides unlimited stash for materials ammo and extra cosmetic items the game can still be played without these with little to no problem probably wait until a sale but it s fun to play with a lot of issues thankfully ironed out,started empty game random disconnections repeatedly crashing missions npc events bugged fallout eventually turned game unlike previous fallout games mmo playing alongside players majority game played events benefiting teams crafting makes return settlements build weapons crafted scrapped components recipes food beverages meds chems crafted correct perks recipes noticeable difference character thirst hunger gauge equipment wears breaks catch diseases mutations ammo weight dealing stash limit balance scavenging levelling perk cards tailor character play style option change required microtransactions paid currency atoms earned game slower rate subscription unlimited stash materials ammo extra cosmetic items game played problem wait fun play lot issues thankfully ironed,started empty game random disconnections repeatedly crashing missions npc events bugged fallout eventually turned game unlike previous fallout games mmo playing alongside players majority game played events benefiting teams crafting makes return settlements build weapons crafted scrapped components recipes food beverages meds chems crafted correct perks recipes noticeable difference character thirst hunger gauge equipment wears breaks catch diseases mutations ammo weight dealing stash limit balance scavenging levelling perk cards tailor character play style option change required microtransactions paid currency atoms earned game slower rate subscription unlimited stash materials ammo extra cosmetic items game played problem wait fun play lot issues thankfully ironed,1,32,0.686650276,3,9,-0.5,0.4,1427,254.0,0.14,101.66,254.0,35,102,1.54,0,5.61,102,0.9943,2

54327,25,Mon,Jan,2021,23:33:03,Fallout 76,"There's potential in this game but there needs to be better access to communities to promote the multiplayer aspect of it. Like a group finder or some kind of guild-like registration. Maybe also increase the amount of people on a single server so that it doesn't feel like you only notice or  interact with other players in sparse instances. I'm sure this game is a lot better if you have a couple friends but there should be more boss battle type events and longer event battles with interesting puzzle like mechanics. Events currently just feel like rinse and repeat events even at higher level and end up feeling like your doing a weekly/monthly chore for a place or person than it is a big event battle that happens sporadically. There also some bad hit delay/registering with weapons and some hits just straight up don't register or don't deal damage. There's also an issue where high level mobs will spawn in low level areas, as I've personally run into level 50 mobs while in a level 20 area. These mobs aren't special or rare spawns either form the seems of it because they were marked like any normal mob but just 30 levels higher than the zone itself. It made doing the escort quest i was doing at the time exceptionally hard. On the subject of mobs I've noticed at times different NPCS will leap through the terrain to attack or attack as well as just straight up glitching out and standing still at times when caught on specific terrain. I don't want to complain too much cause I'm sure there enough out there already but in a game where the idea id ""Fallout with a friend"" It would be nice for a bigger push to help communities come together and or grow, as well as making the main group content more involved.

As for the bad, I do get seemingly random frame drops in groups of three, always. They don't happen often though. During them, my gpu utilization drops as well. Happens to me on every graphics settings. Consistent frames at my capped rate of 130 other than that. (lowering grass from max to high makes gave me 10-20 fps). 

There also seems to be some kb/mouse input problems with attacks not registering, etc. Probably has to do with it being made for controllers and might even be because of the higher framerates.

37357,28,Sat,Jan,2023,19:31:41,Elden Ring,"First off i'd like to say that this game can easily suck in the hours and depending on your taste it can be really enjoyable to some point. Thats why i was on the fence whether or not to give a negative review but finally after reaching endgame i was certain about it:

[h1]PROS: [/h1]

[h1]1. DOPAMINE BASED CONTENT:[/h1] The levels of the world are designed to get you ambushed or put you in a tight position in almost every corner. Of course you will die, learn that enemy is waiting for you there or doing something special that you can avoid next time and come back and have your dopamine rush. This is the good part of the ""hard game"".

[h1]2. SOUND:[/h1] This game's sound effects are really cool and somewhat addicting to hear. Talking about fighting sounds etc.

[h1]3. COMBAT:[/h1] Main reason to play the game. The combat revolves around dodging, there is learning curve to it but once you master the I-frames of the dodge you are good. There are numerous weapons to choose for your build and they all have different quirks you can use. It is generally delayed or clunky by design for you to commit your actions and get punished if there is a spanking needed. Again point number 1. 

[h1]4. STATS AND MINMAXING: [/h1] Other than traditional str/dex/int builts there are a lot of niche stats that you can minmax like Poise or Arcane. Poise is a nice stat you can increase to tank attacks and  trade blows without getting staggered. Poise is a good example of how some of the mechanics of the game are working under the hood. Of course I looked it up online, there is no explaination whatsoever in the game what Poise does and how much of it you actually need to make yourself stagger immune to light attacks etc.

[h1]CONS:[/h1]
[h1]1.  DESIGN:[/h1] This game's story reveals itself to you through google, wikis, youtube. There is no way you can possibly find every ending, every single quest NPC or item on your own. Goodluck if you play offline, you'll miss 40% of the content. I'll give an example of how bad this ""cryptic"" design choice is (SPOILER): [spoiler] After getting to the snowy area, you are given a task to find 2 medallions which is pretty straightforward and easy to find. After it you might search the map and think ""where can i put this medallion in now"" and go back to the elevator you came into snowy area from. Once you are there you search for a slot to use the medallion but there isnt any. You look it up and see that its the same slot but you just need to switch the visible ""prompt"" on the slot...

The fact that there is also 1000 written messages on the slot didn't help because its basically the same prompt you get in the whole game. I had to look that up online (as i did like 20+ times for other things already) Why not make another slot into vicinity?... [/spoiler]This is a good example of the design choice that Fromsoftware is so proud of but it really makes the game opposite of a good, polished game. Why everything in the game has to make the player endure the difficulties left and right; even questing system? Why the opposite of ""quality of life improvement"" approach? Why PC players have to abide by controller keybindings (I used keyboard and mouse, it doesnt feel that much difficult to beat the game; but it shows the lazy port of the game from console), does the game come with one? I assume people like this game to the death because you get relief once you beat it, like you get relief when you get out of a tough or lame situation IRL. 

Also this game makes everything so unimmersive that at some point I took the risk and accepted the fact that i will miss out on content rather looking them up online.

[h1]2. NPCS:[/h1] I really wanted a talisman I looked up online. I did everything step by step but game refused to get the NPC in the correct position for me to exhaust her dialogue. ([i]Why cant they just tell whatever they wanna tell in one go, instead you need to endure the same voicelines and stare at blank, low poly face of an emotionless NPC to get the questline progressed with each NPC- lame cryptic design choice again[/i]) After getting too stuck with it, i skipped that NPC and her questline.

[h1]3. Intentionally unfair NPCs:[/h1] OK this game markets itself as ""a hard game"" that caters to certain people who likes the challenge and whatnot. I am also in that category and like challenging games but some mobs and Bosses are just designed to get you killed until you figure out a way to cheese them to the death. Like Ulcerated Tree Spirit or sword dual wielding Knights in the snowy area. The Ulcerated Tree Spirit is put in tight room ([i]half of it is the tree spirit itself[/i]) that when you lock on it your camera just gets into the behind the mesh of the room half of the time - and the other half you just hit and miss your dodges until you finally get lucky with it. OR you can just spam greatsword jump attack and go for critical hit. That brings the point of...

[h1]4. BALANCE:[/h1] This game has none. Some weapons and builds are just like easy mode on. You can stagger almost anything with a greatsword jump attack and go for easy critical hits. There is literally no point to use any other weapon unless you want to create your own fun/immersion. Don't get me started with ""realistic weapons"" like straight swords etc. They are useless compared to OP builds like greatsword STR build.

[h1]5. PVP and Cheating:[/h1] This game has no protection against offline item creating/duping/zipping/warping. Sure, go ahead and invest hours into your mega-invasion build only to discover people are already have everything in a single run whereas you have to play NG4+ to get to that point. 

Invasions are unfair anyway, why would you want to play 1v2 or possibly 1v3 ? Whats the point of this mechanic of pitting 1 invader against at least 2 defenders? Why can't we have 1v1 pvp content like we used to in earlier titles? I never lost a single match as a blue defender spirit thingy - you know why? Because we 9/10 times outnumbered the poor fella who invaded the host...

Matchmaking is also not that good, you can go against people who have cheesed this game to the brink while you are at that point where you arent even done with the Capital.

[h1]6. OPENWORLD:[/h1] This game has none. Stop calling this game an openworld game. This game is just an enlarged dark souls game where you cant progress an area from another without defeating the area boss . You have some caves, catacombs and underground locations you can discover in the areas before the main boss of the region but there is really not much incentive to do so. Since ""the build"" of your choice will focus on 1-2 weapons and 1-2 stats you only need like 2% of all items that are available to get the gear you want to use. Rest is -in terms of rewards and loot- feels like Ubisoft's AC Valhalla filler content: ""Ah another staff or spell i'll never use for my melee focused toon after spending half an hour clearing the dungeon.""

You can occasionally peek in the other areas using some ""sending gates"" but the game almost yells at you to take what you need in the vicinity and turn back at that point anyway... 

There is nothing to do in the world but clearing it from monsters, finding upgrade materials and finding cryptic, senseless, unimmersive NPCs singing a weird song about how world is so bad. Like openworld comes hand in hand with some crafting system right; because of the all the things you collect in the lands you roam? I haven't crafted an item i actually needed in this game other than frigging arrows. 

[h1]7. GRAPHICS:[/h1] The artwork of the game is the saving grace of the visual aspect. Its time to upgrade your Dark Souls 1 tier graphic assets Fromsoftware. It got milked enough. Even attack animations are more or less the same for most weapons / mobs. 

Overall, although its not a bad game, its just not good enough like how critics praise it to the heavens.",first off i d like to say that this game can easily suck in the hours and depending on your taste it can be really enjoyable to some point thats why i was on the fence whether or not to give a negative review but finally after reaching endgame i was certain about it hone pros hone hone one

Not many people like the Campaign but I thoroughly enjoyed the story behind it. Most of the Boss fights were lackluster but the side missions and storyline picked up the slack.

In a game like this, Loot is always desired and a lot of the hate was around the terrible drop rates. Since then, they've increased Legendary drops by 100% and adjusted the loot pool for greater chances to receive an item you don't already have, which has been fantastic!

I enjoy my solo play so if you're looking to spend 50+ hours immersed in a story, sampling different builds with different weapons and pushing yourself to CT15 solo... then now's the time to do it.

Very good use of open world, fighting mechanics, power scaling, stat management, tool use, crafting, storytelling, in-game currency, scenery, character designs, art styles, sound effects, music, and other things i am sure other people have already brought up about the game way back when it first came out.

I am usually INTENTIONALLY late to the party, so i can get the benefits of properly balanced games, without the drawbacks of buying a brand new, full-priced game. I got this absolute masterpiece on sale... 11 months after it came out. I have been greatly rewarded for my patience.

Much like in the game, if you are persistent, patient, and curious, you'll likely win against every obstacle. You'll also likely enjoy everything this game has to offer. It is littered with amazing views, interesting characters, fun/ridiculous weapons, cool combat/utility abilities, and cool looking ""armor.""

It's also incredibly accessible, in my opinion. I can think of no reason [aside from giving up] that ANYONE would fail to beat this game. I haven't beaten it yet, but everything i try seems to work, with a little practice. Doesn't matter how silly my ideas are, they all seem to work, with a minor amount of practice. I imagine that for people who aren't quite as experienced with hard games as i am, it might be a steeper climb, but i believe anyone can get there if they just take the time to learn some basics. The satisfaction from beating someone you had trouble with, or thought was impossible to beat, is just irreplaceable.

115651,12,Sat,Jun,2021,18:11:11,Destiny 2,"I GOD DAMN HATE this game

To elaborate, this game is very fun. The gun-play is smooth, even having an entire mechanic designed to make it more so, and the potential is through the roof, all exotics have their own specific personalities and qualities tied to them and some of the stories are amazing! A N D  J U S T  L O O K  A T  T H A T  L O R E ! ! !

however, notice how I never said anything was good? I said the potential is substantial and all the exotics have their own personality.  there are so many things that are being sacrificed for the sake of exclusively monetary profit.

and I get ""They're a business"" Blah blah blah, heard that bullshit thousands of time before... but that's the thing, it's just used as a blanket defense for all companies ever and it just nullifies everything you could possibly say, because that's all they're doing it for. 

Not your fun, not your monetary efficiency, not for you, not for the player-base, for money, nothing more, anything else isn't cared about. if it can't pay the employees, it's not worth.

... I wasn't there for it, but there was a time when that was frowned upon.

most of the guns haven't been touched for nearly 2 years now, the player-base can be a massive pain in the ass, and nothing's changed unless it's incredibly exploitable. I can name multiple OoB spots on my own, without utilizing anything too drastic at all. No salvation's grip, no Glacier grenades, no nothing.

and then there's the cesspool that is crucible... so shoved up they're own ass and obsessed with victory that you'll never see something out of the ordinary until about a thousand hours. you see it once, you'll see it a thousand more times.

and then there was the content purge of 2020, that they're still fixing...

for reference, for better or for worse, ive spent a lot of time with the settlement system in fallout 4. I enjoy that system, as flawed as it was, and that was essentially the only thing that had me in a choke-hold about fallout 4. thats what kept (and keeps) me playing fallout 4. if you can believe it, fallout 76 gets rid of that in favor of CAMP, where you can essentially build wherever but it's not a base for settlers, just for the player. Workshop locations still exist, but are behind the shroud of ""PLAYERS CAN TAKE THIS FROM YOU"" in 76, so like, why bother?

but i digress. 76 loses what little bit of the fallout franchise 4 had going for it, and now 76 is completely unrecognizable. that being said, ill run through a few likes and dislikes of this game

+GREAT map. stunning visuals and maybe one of my favorite settings for a post-apoc game, especially fallout. a ton of interesting locations
+the guns look and feel great. gun play has never been a strong suit of the franchise, but the guns look really nice in this game

-i hate the new card system. i already hated the streamlined system in 4 for skills, but 76 makes me actually hate the new skill system.
-the world feels lifeless. thankfully i didn't play at launch, but i did see when it released without NPCs in the world, which was bizarre to me. a fallout game without NPCs? even with the NPCs, they definitely feel like they were added after the fact
-as mentioned before, this game doesn't really give any incentive to keep playing. im guessing its different with friends, but it is really boring playing solo, which i hate for a fallout game.
-is there even a story? i know the overseer stuff exists, but that felt like just a terribly rushed excuse to just move around the world.
-the CAMP system is like OK at best and annoying and doesn't feel like its worth it at its worst.

- Campaign starts with the most nauseating cliche storyline that literally makes you want to vomit. I tolerated that for 20 minutes then wanted to get into blasting shit with mechs. Farting about finding batteries for someone elses mech is the first mission after a on-rails yeehaw vomit inducing series of insanely badly acted cutscenes 

so I decided multiplayer would be the place to blast mechs

- Like all EA matchmaking games, I could not find a game.

Pros: I only paid 3.99 for this absolutely typical EA experience
Cons: I wanted to blast mechs and was duped by EA again. $3.99 should barely cover valve fees though, hopefully - because I'm pretty sure you shouldn't make profit producing and selling this stuff.

WHEN you can play, its a very fun multiplayer game for sure. I still don't care for the single player storymode.

But, only so far as they want you to. More often than not I found that my maneuvers and flanking routes were instead blocked by invisible barriers that led me to be railroaded to really obvious and specific paths, While the gameplay itself is very fun, it constantly feels like missed opportunities for a much more enjoyable game. There are only maybe 2 levels where you have make significantly different choices in your progression paths toward the goal and even those are something like choose a, b, or c, while terrain would visually suggest you have several other options.

Gave up on the game and let it go down the drain. In 2021 both the servers for Apex and Titanfall were hacked in an ""attempt"" to ""save Titanfall."" This only further pushed the neglect.

13458,12,Thu,Aug,2021,00:15:58,Borderlands 3,"I played this game on console when it first came out.  I didn't really enjoy it then.  It felt like the drop rates for legendaries were pitiful, the guns were not fun or interesting, and the story was trash.  I can definitely say that the legendary weapon drop rate has improved.  There are also vendors that exclusively sell legendary weapons as well, so they have attempted to fix that issue.  

The story is trash.  The characters are so cringeworthy.  It's as if the developers are out to prove to all the youngsters how hip they can be.  Seriously, Claptrap isn't even the most annoying character.  The dialogue is almost exclusively inane babbling.  

Performance wise this game is hell on my rig.  I don't have a super high end PC, but this game had a TON of problems at launch because it was not optimized, and I still feel like it taxes my PC way more than other games.  It feels poorly optimized even still.  I have stuttering, frame drops, and huge amounts of freezing routinely.  Just now the game crashed prior to even getting to the main menu.  The crash was so bad, it locked up my PC and required me to power cycle.  Now, the game won't even launch or get past the gearbox logo.  This performance is abysmal, and I decided to thumb it down on that point alone.

I want my money back, and Gearbox should be absolutely ashamed that they produced such a terribly broken game and requested money for it.  There are lower budget games that are designed far better than this atrocity.

Edit: The game is not any better.  Now that DX12 has been introduced, the game will crash on launch.  

So it has gone from a state of being unplayable due to bugs - to now being unplayable because of an API that breaks the game.  What a disaster.

Honestly, I feel like I've been scammed.  

I paid money for a game that does not run properly out of the box.  Check the Reddit posts, or even the Gearbox support page; most of - if not all the people playing this game had to complete a workaround.

Edit #2: I managed to run the game on DX11, it still crashed a couple times but it wasn't a big deal.  I'm still not recommending this game for anything other than its visuals and gameplay.

The story is really a step down from BL2; the villains are not very captivating, the vault hunter still doesn't play a definitive role in the story, and by the end you're left with so many questions.  It seemed as if all the writers from BL2 packed up and left during development.

There were some complaints about this game pandering to a female audience, but from my perspective this game just did a lot of things wrong from the jump.  Games like Nier: Automata in comparison does female leading so much justice - but then again there was actually thought and detail in the story; so everything just made sense and blended so well.

Beyond the visuals - which can be over the top sometimes, and the fluid - yet repetitive gameplay, I can't say there is much else to this game.

18056,4,Thu,Mar,2021,02:06:15,Borderlands 3,"Generally a good game, with some mildly annoying aspects. Let me start by saying this: this game has made major improvements on the previous entries, mostly in its new mechanics. Vehicle customization, more character skill customization, more items and item variations, and mounting and sliding, to name a few. Gameplay-wise, it is sooo much fun to play. 

The story was alright in my opinion. it wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either. There seemed to be a huge bias leading to the importance of female characters, while the male ones were kind of sidelined. It had moments where characters seemed to do nothing when they absolutely could've done something to stop the villian(s), and had me asking ""why didn't they just do this?"" It was entertaining though, albeit at points it fell to a grind as it felt like the finish line just kept getting moved.

I was disappointed to find they removed the badass ranks in favor of ""guardian ranks,"" basically the same mechanic, but only accessible after the main story is finished. It was modified, to get skins and perks out of more guardian ranks though, so there is an incentive. Gearbox also added a ""mayhem mode,"" adding modifiers and difficulty to play and rewarding you with better loot, although it doesn't really make it much harder. It gives you a couple extra things to look out for but mostly just makes every enemy a bullet sponge.

Overall, a good addition to the series, with some downsides. I played casually on my first run, completing the main story in about 50-60 hours, with some deviation for side quests. I've played 3 of the DLCs so far and I like them even better than the main story. It is wildly fun to play though, and although I have only played with Fl4k so far, I plan to do a max level run with each character.",generally a good game with some mildly annoying aspects let me start by saying this this game has made major improvements on the previous entries mostly in its new mechanics vehicle customization more character skill customization more items and item variations and mounting and sliding to name a few gameplay wise it is sooo much fun to play the story was alright in my opinion it wasn t great but it wasn t horrible either there seemed to be a huge bias leading to the importance of female characters while the male ones were kind of sidelined it had moments where characters seemed to do nothing when they absolutely could ve done something to stop the villian s and had me asking why didn t they just do this it was entertaining though albeit at points it fell to a grind as it felt like the finish line just kept getting moved i was disappointed to find they removed the badass ranks in favor of guardian ranks basically the same mechanic but only accessible after the main story is finished it was modified to get skins and perks out of more guardian ranks though so there is an incentive gearbox also added a mayhem mode adding modifiers and difficulty to play and rewarding you with better loot although it doesn t really make it much harder it gives you a couple extra things to look out for but mostly just makes every enemy a bullet sponge overall a good addition to the series with some downsides i played casually on my first run completing the main story in about fifty sixty hours with some deviation for side quests i ve played three of the dlcs so far and i like them even better than the main story it is wildly fun to play though and although i have only played with fl4k so far i plan to do a max level run with each character,generally game mildly annoying aspects start game made improvements previous entries mechanics vehicle customization character skill customization items item variations mounting sliding gameplay sooo fun play alright opinion great horrible huge leading importance female characters male kind sidelined moments characters absolutely stop villian entertaining albeit points grind felt finish line moved disappointed find removed badass ranks favor guardian ranks basically mechanic accessible finished modified skins perks guardian ranks incentive gearbox added mayhem mode adding modifiers difficulty play rewarding loot make couple extra things makes enemy bullet sponge addition series downsides played casually run completing hours deviation side quests played dlcs wildly fun play played fl4k plan level run character,generally game mildly annoying aspects start game made improvements previous entries mechanics vehicle customization character skill customization items item variations mounting sliding gameplay sooo fun play alright opinion great horrible huge leading importance female characters male kind sidelined moments characters absolutely stop villian entertaining albeit points grind felt finish line moved disappointed find removed badass ranks favor guardian ranks basically mechanic accessible finished modified skins perks guardian ranks incentive gearbox added mayhem mode adding modifiers difficulty play rewarding loot make couple extra things makes enemy bullet sponge addition series downsides played casually run completing hours deviation side quests played dlcs wildly fun play played fl4k plan level run character,1,1,0.523809552,10,11,-0.05,0.7,1746,324.0,0.12,129.65,324.0,39,109,1.49,8,5.39,109,0.9962,0

I know that's kind of always the case these days, but this one is unusually bad.  There are so many bugs and disconnections that it's just super frustrating.  I want to like it.  Some day this will probably be pretty fun.  

The good:
+ Good Story
+ Long basic campaign
+ Several play style / build choices
+ Some truly epic fights in the campaign
+ Fun End Game Missions

The bad:
- All the different ways you can crash: joining game, leaving game, middle of a fight
- Skills randomly locking out
- load in game, but no HUD, can't shoot or use skills
- just got crashed and reloading the game? Here watch the super long intro and then the anti-cheat will trigger and close you out of the game so you can do it again
- Epics are usually better than Legendary items because Legendary items have fixed stats with nonsensical combinations (boggle).  Kind of ruins the loot chase.  Set items are even worse.  You can chose to wear 3 items with subpar stats to get a set bonus that isn't that great.... Basically the only reason you want Legendary or set armor is to disassemble it to get the mod to put on an epic.  And that's only a couple of them per class.
- You can't chose what challenge tier you want to join in match making.  This results in under geared players constantly joining matches too high for them. 
- endgame requires a lot of joining and leaving games, and each time there's a good chance of disconnect
- in multiplayer, only the host has a lag free game.  The other two players get to try to shoot stuff while rubber banding like mad

With that said, i'm off to play more stable games.  I may try this again after a few more patches.

10317,28,Tue,Dec,2021,01:35:55,Borderlands 3,"Managed to get all the achievements the other day and-- [b]oh! I love Borderlands 3 so much <3[/b] Definitely one of the best games I've played this year. Loved it waaaaaay-way more than BL 1 and 2. People who think writing used to be better are delusional and clearly haven't touched these games in years.

Initially, I made a mistake of listening to my partner, who played the game on release when it came on Epic and said that he had a big problem with character skill variety and storyline and therefore didn't like the game at all. When I played it myself I quickly realized I couldn't agree with most of the complaints that he had and fell in love with the game almost from the start. I think I even got slightly addicted at some point, haha. Funny enough, upon joining me to play BL3 he kind of changed his mind and we ended up playing through the entire game together and-- both of us had a really good time! Moral of the story... it's not as bad as people say? (??????)

On the other hand, this game has a huge problem with bugs that will never be fixed. It seriously has some of the worst bugs I've seen in such a high-budget game. Skills often don't work, Moze's mech doesn't shoot, Iron Cub doesn't follow you and can break completely, FL4K's pets get stuck in places too, Amara's skills have some minor visual glitches, NPCs don't appear\move and-- one of the DLCs has this weird feature that can completely mute the current dialog and break subtitles to it while NPCs do what they're programmed to do anyway... The list goes on, but these are the most annoying ones that I could remember. 
Luckily, it all gets fixed on restart, but-- still annoying. 

Really liked the overall level design, character design. Skins and heads are really sweet and easy to get-- And so many guns that are fun to use! + The entire atmosphere of Guns, Love, and Tentacles was amazing. Actually, all the DLCs were really enjoyable.

Tyreen is bae <3",managed to get all the achievements the other day and b oh i love borderlands three so much three b definitely one of the best games i ve played this year loved it waaaaaay way more than bl one and two people who think writing used to be better are delusional and clearly haven t touched these games in years initially i made a mistake of listening to my partner who played the game on release when it came on epic and said that he had a big problem with character skill variety and storyline and therefore didn t like the game at all when i played it myself i quickly realized i couldn t agree with most of the complaints that he had and fell in love with the game almost from the start i think i even got slightly addicted at some point haha funny enough upon joining me to play blthree he kind of changed his mind and we ended up playing through the entire game together and both of us had a really good time moral of the story it s not as bad as people say on the other hand this game has a huge problem with bugs that will never be fixed it seriously has some of the worst bugs i ve seen in such a high budget game skills often don t work moze s mech doesn t shoot iron cub doesn t follow you and can break completely fl4k s pets get stuck in places too amara s skills have some minor visual glitches npcs don t appear move and one of the dlcs has this weird feature that can completely mute the current dialog and break subtitles to it while npcs do what they re programmed to do anyway the list goes on but these are the most annoying ones that i could remember luckily it all gets fixed on restart but still annoying really liked the overall level design character design skins and heads are really sweet and easy to get and so many guns that are fun to use the entire atmosphere of guns love and tentacles was amazing actually all the dlcs were really enjoyable tyreen is bae three,managed achievements borderlands games played loved waaaaaay bl people writing delusional touched games years initially made mistake listening partner played game release epic big problem character skill variety storyline game played quickly realized agree complaints game start slightly addicted point haha funny joining play blthree kind changed mind ended playing entire game time moral bad people game huge problem bugs fixed worst bugs budget game skills work moze mech shoot iron cub follow break completely fl4k pets stuck places amara skills visual glitches npcs move dlcs weird feature completely mute current dialog break subtitles npcs programmed list annoying remember luckily fixed restart annoying level design character design skins heads easy guns fun entire atmosphere guns tentacles amazing dlcs enjoyable tyreen bae,managed achievements borderlands games played loved waaaaaay bl people writing delusional touched games years initially made mistake listening partner played game release epic big problem character skill variety storyline game played quickly realized agree complaints game start slightly addicted point haha funny joining play blthree kind changed mind ended playing entire game time moral bad people game huge problem bugs fixed worst bugs budget game skills work moze mech shoot iron cub follow break completely fl4k pets stuck places amara skills visual glitches npcs move dlcs weird feature completely mute current dialog break subtitles npcs programmed list annoying remember luckily fixed restart annoying level design character design skins heads easy guns fun entire atmosphere guns tentacles amazing dlcs enjoyable tyreen bae,1,2,0.541121721,9,18,-0.33,0.9,1890,370.0,0.09,148.04,370.0,35,121,1.41,13,5.11,121,0.9996,0

101505,3,Fri,Mar,2023,08:06:46,Destiny 2,"Ive played destiny 2 since the beta with 1400 hours on PS4 and 1200 hours on steam. I have loved the game all the way up to Forsaken. The following change in direction of Bungie has brought me write this negative review
- This new trend of season pass grind and FOMO
- Story and content is drip fed just to maintain player count over the year rather than releasing fun content/activities to keep players coming back
- Half baked seasonal activity over a well planned activity that stays in the game
- For the price of a new game you get 8 hours of Marvel cinematic campaign and only 4 sets of armour (one being an extra $30). How can Bungie justify this considering they have 800 employees working on this for a whole year.
- New characters (like Nimbus) that are happy-go-lucky in a story about the brink of collapse for humans. Unlike Cayde who had a witty and dark side, these characters are just aloof and goofy 24/7, ruining what could be a dark and gritty story.
- Remember when Bungie claimed there would be a new enemy type with the arrival of the pyramid ships? What tf happened with that? New enemies are just re skinned and recycled old enemies with some new dumb twist (the red legion/shadow legion, Taken/every enemy type, the fallen/scorn, hive/lucent hive) 

I feel the soul of Destiny is gone with the new direction of minimal effort dlc just to update the store with new micro-transactions and get that new game revenue without having to actually make a new game. I was more than happy in the past for them to take their time and release a big expansion with fun activities like EP and the reckoning with a well thought out story. 

The game does play well and there are some fun activities but these are things that have been apart of Destiny 2 from the beginning. Every other game I play has been releasing new content for free each season with new activities (fallout 76, bf2042, division 2, etc.) and yet they are still receiving hate (initial criticism was deserved) while Destiny 2 is blindly defended. I don't expect Destiny dlc to be free of course but if I'm paying a full game price I expect it to be better than this poor excuse of an expansion.",ive played destiny two since the beta with one thousand four hundred hours on psfour and 1two00 hours on steam i have loved the game all the way up to forsaken the following change in direction of bungie has brought me write this negative review this new trend of season pass grind and fomo story and content is drip fed just to maintain player count over the year rather than releasing fun content activities to keep players coming back half baked seasonal activity over a well planned activity that stays in the game for the price of a new game you get eight hours of marvel cinematic campaign and only four sets of armour one being an extra dollar thirty how can bungie justify this considering they have eight00 employees working on this for a whole year new characters like nimbus that are happy go lucky in a story about the brink of collapse for humans unlike cayde who had a witty and dark side these characters are just aloof and goofy twofour seven ruining what could be a dark and gritty story remember when bungie claimed there would be a new enemy type with the arrival of the pyramid ships what tf happened with that new enemies are just re skinned and recycled old enemies with some new dumb twist the red legion shadow legion taken every enemy type the fallen scorn hive lucent hive i feel the soul of destiny is gone with the new direction of minimal effort dlc just to update the store with new micro transactions and get that new game revenue without having to actually make a new game i was more than happy in the past for them to take their time and release a big expansion with fun activities like ep and the reckoning with a well thought out story the game does play well and there are some fun activities but these are things that have been apart of destiny two from the beginning every other game i play has been releasing new content for free each season with new activities fallout seven6 bftwo0fourtwo division two etc and yet they are still receiving hate initial criticism was deserved while destiny two is blindly defended i don t expect destiny dlc to be free of course but if i m paying a full game price i expect it to be better than this poor excuse of an expansion,ive played beta hours psfour 1two00 hours steam loved game forsaken change direction bungie brought write negative review trend grind fomo content drip fed maintain count releasing fun content activities players coming half baked seasonal activity planned activity stays game game hours cinematic campaign sets extra bungie justify eight00 employees working characters nimbus happy collapse humans unlike cayde witty dark side characters aloof goofy twofour ruining dark gritty remember bungie claimed enemy type arrival pyramid ships tf happened enemies skinned recycled enemies dumb twist legion shadow legion enemy type fallen scorn hive lucent hive feel soul direction minimal effort dlc update store micro transactions game revenue make game happy past time release big expansion fun activities ep reckoning thought game play fun activities things beginning game play releasing content activities fallout seven6 bftwo0fourtwo division receiving hate initial criticism deserved blindly defended expect dlc paying full game expect poor excuse expansion,ive played beta hours psfour 1two00 hours steam loved game forsaken change direction bungie brought write negative review trend grind fomo content drip fed maintain count releasing fun content activities players coming half baked seasonal activity planned activity stays game game hours cinematic campaign sets extra bungie justify eight00 employees working characters nimbus happy collapse humans unlike cayde witty dark side characters aloof goofy twofour ruining dark gritty remember bungie claimed enemy type arrival pyramid ships tf happened enemies skinned recycled enemies dumb twist legion shadow legion enemy type fallen scorn hive lucent hive feel soul direction minimal effort dlc update store micro transactions game revenue make game happy past time release big expansion fun activities ep reckoning thought game play fun activities things beginning game play releasing content activities fallout seven6 bftwo0fourtwo division receiving hate initial criticism deserved blindly defended expect dlc paying full game expect poor excuse expansion,0,7,0.543740571,7,23,-0.53,1.0,2200,405.0,0.14,162.06,405.0,55,150,1.52,7,5.43,150,-0.9101,3

11252,26,Fri,Nov,2021,23:26:41,Borderlands 3,"This is more Borderlands, which is good. But it's also borderlands 3, which is bad. Borderlands 3 has a lackluster main story. The callypso twins were a good concept villain but were executed terribly. 

In terms of replay-ability, sure, it's there. There's a ton of guns and whatnot so if you like dickin' around with min maxing and trying to get stuff to work, pick it up, hit each vault hunter to max level, then see if you want to keep playing. 

The devs put a lot of work into rebalancing things, screwing it up, and rebalancing again. But then Tediore as a whole got nerfed, just flat damage. Specifically to prevent abuse in the arms race mode, which sucks ass anyway. So players who didn't bother picking up season pass 2 (which is another pile of shit that gearbox should not have done), just saw a bunch of guns/Tediore chuck builds become obsolete. Y'know. Tediore. The kind of gun that you're supposed to chuck. 

Pick this up when it's on a riiiidiculous sale, maybe something like 30 bucks for base game and season pass 1 and 2. 

As for their upcoming game Wonderlands, don't even get it day one of it's steam release (also fuck you gearbox for even doing the timed exclusive, it's dumb, but hey someone has to pay for Randy Bitchford's pornography and shit magic habits, and I guess that someone is Tim Sweeny). Wait for it to go on sale, read reviews of a ""season pass 2"" if there is one, and then judge accordingly whether you think the amount they want to charge is what you wan't to pay for that game.

Considering the fact that Gearbox doesn't know what the word ""balance"" means, I'd strongly recommend staying away from it. Just, don't buy wonderlands unless at the time of it's release/of the time of the release of a POS season pass 2, that the game is balanced, has a decent ""endgame,"" and whether or not the game is actually fun or not. 

Honestly, from Gearbox saying ""If we don't have a story to tell, we won't tell it."" to the absolutely abysmal story of this game, I don't think I'll buy Wonderlands. 

Everyone who LOVED borderlands 2 was waiting for you to knock it out of the park, but ya hit a solid double. Not bad, Not great.

Pros:
- Has a reasonably lengthy demo, gives you a pretty good idea of what you can expect from the game.
- Generous with loot. Seriously once you get closer to endgame every mission is like a Rift in Diablo, you come out stuffed with loot.
- Fun class gameplay: Classes are diverse and fun to play, and feel strong compared to world enemies.
- Shooting mechanics range from serviceable to quite fun (some guns need a little tuning).
- Dynamic gameplay: The game strikes an interesting balance between cover shooting and aggression, it takes a little getting used to but once it clicks, combat has a great flow.
- Gear modding is incredibly op, you can tune your abilities to god-like levels and the game does little to restrain you, it feels like they want you to be as deadly as possible.
- Story/voice acting are actually not bad, I didn't expect to care about the story in a loot shooter but I'm surprisingly invested.
- Aesthetics: The game looks pretty good, and the gear all has a great sci-fi/mad max vibe.

Cons:
- A bit slow to start considering most people know how to play games of this type, but once you get past to prologue on one character, you always have the option to skip it in the future, a nice touch.
- Combat could still use a little tuning, some final battle/boss areas feel overly difficult for certain classes/builds. Occasional drastic difficulty spikes, but can be remedied by turning down world difficulty.
- Servers are still not great, expecting this too be fixed obviously but it is still an issue.
- Some guns (sniper rifles) just feel undertuned and tedious (unless you're playing the one subclass that's actually built to make them worth using, and even then I still prefer mid-range guns). Feels like there are very few encounters so far where sniping in solo-play is even an option.
- Melee abilities are iffy at best when you're getting swarmed by enemies, but awareness and good weapon/ability loadouts usually ensure that it's not too much of an issue.
- Minor, but there are definitely abilities/loadouts that are much, much stronger than others within each class, hopefully we'll see a bump to the more lackluster abilities in the future to increase build diversity.'

Overall, I'd say this game (at least as much as I've played so far), is a solid 7.5/10.

Aside from the deeper rooted issues the game is a lot of fun to play, there seems to be a lot of variety and end game grind is fun so far. I think it may get boring eventually but as they plan to release DLC I hope it will add more variety/things to do. I wish there was a chat system for PC players but you work with what you're given. 

The modding and class system is fun as it will allow you to customize your build. The different classes seem relatively balanced although a first playthrough may be easier on one character compared to another. Aside from the game randomly crashing, or the UI bug that doesn't allow you to do anything in game I haven't experienced many issues.

I'm a huge fan of the Fallout series and wanted to play through at least enough of it to be able to appreciate the new lore.  After 50 hours of tolerating the subpar writing, the meaningless quests, and the pointless presence of online players running around me, making asses of themselves, I've decided it's not worth it.  I regret to inform you that I cannot grant this game canon status; it is best thought of as a cheap cash-in alongside Fallout Shelter, and should be quarantined well away from the legitimate Fallout games.

40204,5,Fri,May,2023,08:02:26,Fallout 76,"Fallout 76 is a very average looking game, even when it was released it was regarded as such. The characters are so forgettable, and sometimes so annoying you cannot wait to forget them. Repetitive quests with annoying daily quests and special events that never even end up being anything worth your time. 

In my opinion, this is the worst of all the Fallout titles. Fallout 4, while far from great, was a game with some good fun, characters you had interest in talking to. The scenery was pretty amazing, being set in such an iconic city like Boston. The early game hooks you with a cool opening series of events that are just wild, and truly sad, followed by some exciting first fights and objectives. 

New Vegas is a wonderful title that is truly the most unique. Every character has brains, even if they aren't all there. You end up laughing at some  of the dialogue and scenes throughout the game. The weapons are great fun along with the many enemies in a barren wasteland of dirt and dust, with graphics that are not groundbreaking, but certainly have a charm that works throughout the entire game. 

This continues as you go back in the years, then Fallout 76. No life, DOA. Even now in 2023, It just hasn't hooked me once. Not a single character I have met, or location I have visited have excited me in any way really. I play this game casually, and occasionally, if that. This title had so much potential, and it was all completely wasted. 

I hope the next time around Bethesda takes the game they develop seriously. They surely do take our money pretty seriously...",fallout seventy six is a very average looking game even when it was released it was regarded as such the characters are so forgettable and sometimes so annoying you cannot wait to forget them repetitive quests with annoying daily quests and special events that never even end up being anything worth your time in my opinion this is the worst of all the fallout titles fallout four while far from great was a game with some good fun characters you had interest in talking to the scenery was pretty amazing being set in such an iconic city like boston the early game hooks you with a cool opening series of events that are just wild and truly sad followed by some exciting first fights and objectives new vegas is a wonderful title that is truly the most unique every character has brains even if they aren t all there you end up laughing at some of the dialogue and scenes throughout the game the weapons are great fun along with the many enemies in a barren wasteland of dirt and dust with graphics that are not groundbreaking but certainly have a charm that works throughout the entire game this continues as you go back in the years then fallout seventy six no life doa even now in two thousand twenty three it just hasn t hooked me once not a single character i have met or location i have visited have excited me in any way really i play this game casually and occasionally if that this title had so much potential and it was all completely wasted i hope the next time around bethesda takes the game they develop seriously they surely do take our money pretty seriously,fallout average game released regarded characters forgettable annoying wait forget repetitive quests annoying quests events end time opinion worst fallout titles fallout great game fun characters interest talking scenery pretty amazing set iconic game opening series events sad exciting fights objectives wonderful title unique character brains end laughing dialogue scenes game weapons great fun enemies barren wasteland dirt dust graphics groundbreaking charm works entire game continues years fallout life doa hooked single character met location visited excited play game casually occasionally title potential completely wasted time bethesda takes game develop surely pretty,fallout average game released regarded characters forgettable annoying wait forget repetitive quests annoying quests events end time opinion worst fallout titles fallout great game fun characters interest talking scenery pretty amazing set iconic game opening series events sad exciting fights objectives wonderful title unique character brains end laughing dialogue scenes game weapons great fun enemies barren wasteland dirt dust graphics groundbreaking charm works entire game continues years fallout life doa hooked single character met location visited excited play game casually occasionally title potential completely wasted time bethesda takes game develop surely pretty,0,6,0.487343729,13,14,-0.04,0.9,1573,289.0,0.15,115.66,289.0,44,92,1.53,5,5.44,92,-0.9973,3

Long version

Combat
For starters the combat, gunplay, enemies e.t.c. are not too bad with weapons feeling solid as hell, heavy hitting when necessary. Main pros of the combat have to be gunplay and the abilities as they have short cooldowns compared to destiny and even borderlands with the longest being roughly a minute and can be shortened with the right perks. They feel absolutely amazing when you gib something with a ground pound or freeze everything around you with the push of a button. The weapons feel amazing with shotguns and smgs being the true spotlights as they seriously excel in their desired ranges compared to sniper rifles and assault rifles.
Cons sadly outnumber the good as the enemy AI and balancing especially in the late campaign are genuinely terrible with enemies being complete bullet sponges, 1 shotting you and pushing you all the way back to your spawn in a matter of seconds not to mention they throw WAY too many at you and it only gets worse if you have friends with you since it roughly doubles and triples depending on your squad size and on top of that BOOSTING the already tanky HP making every small fight a real slog with friends. Weapons also get into the list as the entire sniper rifle category is useless with so little damage on some and damage drop off (seriously) on others, and if you actually try to use them the AI will just rush you or elite enemies will use abilities to get you moving making precise shots next to impossible which penalises players who want to play the dedicated sniper class, like me. The lmg category is a fun choice but the lack of damage and perks namely armor penetration make them complete pea shooters in late game only used to dunk half a mag into a minor enemy and realise that you have barely any ammo left and 20 more enemies to kill.

Graphics
The game is beautiful when it comes to the skyboxes and areas with heavy anomaly effects such as the opening battlefields with blue particles and rubble lying around you. Sadly the transition is very meh as you go from battlefield to battlefield to mountain peak battlefield to forest battlefield and feels like the previous area with a different color chosen instead of brown and grey with a splash of blue.

Bugs 
Ok this game being out for over a week by now has some serious bug issues even for being out for a week.
For starters enemies have spawned inside walls for me or even inside each other multiple times, areas don't load as they should or register that something has happened. A certain bunker you clear you have to press a button to open the window shutters and vault the wall to get through to the next area but the shutters kept not registering they were down making me restart the game constantly until they actually went down which made me kill the same wave of enemies roughly three times in one playthrough. The cutscenes have constant audio sync issues and the characters have their mouths closed half the time when they are talking making the game a weird ventriloquist act and my favourite helmet constantly clipping my characters hair through it and even changing the model of the helmet from a mouth covering balaclava to a full blown military helmet. Not to mention my hud not loading in every. single. time. I boot up the game.

Conclusion
I wanted to keep spoilers out of this so all i will say is story wise it is extremely meh and underwhelming especially since half the boss fights include the certain bastard somehow running away despite them exploding and taking out a mountain or having a giant stone pylon dropped on them. 

IMO this game is 6/10 at best 3/10 at worst with poor optimisation and AI which makes cyberpunk look good. I'd wait for a sale or the game to drop in price before buying but since i already own it I can't.

The price to pay for fun gameplay is atrocious story, characters, and grating voice acting. Ignore everything that isn't gameplay and Borderlands 3 is a game that can help pass the time or something.

There is an audio problem where if you are not directly facing a person, their voice sounds like they are in a different room. This is a blessing in disguise, as this allows you to ignore most people. If you move too far away while they are still talking, however, they will resume dialogue with the radio and you will be able to hear them clearly.
Unfortunately, the audio problem does not apply to certain characters who speak with you telepathically. Their face box will sit right in the middle of your screen obscuring your view every time they talk with you instead of just using the goddamn radio to speak with you.

EDIT: revamped review to be more structured and highlight the issues I had

Coop
First off: 3-player coop max? WTF? Why not 4 like 90% of other coop games? -- I know devs gave an answer to this, but it's literally ""Testing shows that 3 ""feels"" best for our testers"" -- rather than sticking with decades-long convention and letting players decide this for themselves. Numerous times I wanted to delve into another 2-player friend group to bump it up to 4 players but this just wasn't possible.

## Story / The  ""scifi"" setting (Without spoiling):
Started off really cool and fascinating. but I felt the sci-fi and alien-ness of the story to get less so and fall towards really old and cliche tropes near the end. A lot of the alien encounters feel like something I feel like I would see out of resident evil or some other horror-mutationy game than I would of a scifi ""completely alien and incomprehensible"" world kind of one. Lore doesnt' really explain how anything works and the ways in which it does left me feeling kind of underwhelmed when it was actually implemented. Starting off the world seemed really inspiring and wondrous but as the story and lore unraveled, I felt really disappointing in the lack of variance and alienness coming from the design of the planet's inhabitants, just mutated to be more beefy, big and a couple other mutations.Also why does this planet have so many fucking GUNS?! Why are these god-like entities using guns when they're basically walking forces of supernatural destruction?

## Immersion breaking
More. 2-second. cutscenes. every. hour. than. periods. in. this. sentence.
No seriously, they have cutscenes for every trivial and benign thing with a black-out ""loading"" kind of feeling to show it, then ""Black out"" again. Cutting off audio and often left me wondering ""Why isn't this just an animation"" rather than a dedicated cutscene for it? Especially in regards to area transitions and boss encounters. Open a door? CUTSCENE, boss changing phases/dying, CUTSCENE! Honestly the way they tackled this feels like a very amatuerish approach.

## Gunplay
Why do enemy miniguns sound like someone tapping a desk rapidly? Gun shots and 'feel' like toys and don't really make me feel like they're satisfying to fire-- Also, DAMAGE FALLOFF why does my SMG lose ALL damage after 15 meters? Shotguns just straight up won't hit your target at that range. I HATE games that use ""bullet dropoff"" for balancing. Just use accuacy / inaccuracy with pellet count like nearly every other shooter does.This left me ignoring certain gun categories that initially seemed cool because you have to practically be in melee range for something that seems like it should be at least feasible to use at mid-range like an SMG. And If I see an enemy at 1% like at 50 meters, let me use my shotgun and hope a pellet grazes him. I don't get why my bullet feels like they loose all momentum after 15 meters. 

## Build variance
Playing the fire class; A lot of builds will work in the early game when things have no HP and don't do any damage. But as you progress through the game and keeping up with world tier, certain builds just don't scale enough to keep up. Trying to scale all hardcore into abilities you'll do 1/10th the damage of someone just going guns. Most of my abilities felt like falling into that warframe-y feel where some abilities are totally ignored because they just don't scale or do enough damage. Typically the only good skills are ""round"" skills that modify your magazine and other utility/buffer skills. CC skills end up becoming useless in the endgame since the throngs of ""strong"" enemies are mostly CC immune anyways. 

I tried the assassiny class, but it's utterly laughable to think anyone is going to live in melee in the mid/late game with the amount of unblockable BS attacks that are going to be slammed against you. 

Friend tried turret class, but sadly wasn't able to get much build variance with turrets falling through the floor constantly.

If you care at all about public matchmaking, don't both with the tank class since they're frequently kicked out of public groups due to their low damage and squishiness-- and current balance doesn't make them needed since other classes are tankier.

Ultimately Shooter builds triumph all other builds. Likely because it's very easy to hardcore scale guns than it is to scale abilities. Ability (anomaly) power isn't anywhere near as powerful as the insane combination and stacking buffs you get for your guns.

""Round"" skills are VERY powerful buffs to guns that everyone rolls with in the end-game-- this is also the reason why the tank class is completely ""underpowered"" is because they don't have one of these skills while everyone else does.

## Endgame
Due to balance, there only 1 viable build for 3 classes and no viable build for the fourth (Round skills OP). Everything turns into gear-checks and the leveling/gear system has exponential power. Every level you *must* replace or upgrade (Immensely grindy) all of your gear otherwise you're missing out on 20-30% power/armor per level multiplicatively. It's only a 3-4 level difference before the gear has double the stats. Legendary items getting replaced with blue items that are only a few levels higher. Upgrading blues isn't too bad, but trying ot upgrade your purple/legendary is impractically expensive. You'll spend hours trying to upgrade it once-- and by that time you're already so far progressed you'll need to upgrade it multiple times and need exponentially more time to grind to keep it caught up.

## Items
Crafting system is okay, as with above I hate the level-exponential power system. Each level on the gear seems to add ~20-30% power to the item, so only a couple levels and your gear needs total replacing. Really frustrating to do 20 times and feels like those hard-earned legendary become pea canon after 30 minutes. More often then not, you'll salvage your legendary since it'll be more useful to you that way. 

Store wise, I absolutely hate the system. You either salvage items to get parts for crafting, or you sell them to merchants. The cost of items in the stores goes up exponentially with level as well, so as you save up to buy something-- turns out you need to save even more since you leveled up. This repeats until you hit end-game and need to spend an hour grinding to buy one item. And god forbid you want to buy one of the shiny purple/yellow items in which case, happy fun grinding days to get it.",bugs crashed technical issues and the rest aside assuming you get none of that

Where to start with this game... The story is fantastic and it truly saddens me that new players cant experience the game from the start. My only complaint, but I still understand why it is this way, is that the game is not the same as it was when it first released. Meaning new players will enter this game not knowing what the h3ll is happening. Those that have played since day one really know how much a gem this game is.

Those who just jump into the game should know that the F2P aspect of the game is only PVP for the most part. You will need to purchase the expansions in their entirety and from there you can experience the stories. There will be vaulted weapons and expansions so the risk is there that you could be paying money for content that very will may not be there forever.

If you are fine with all that here are some little tips to enjoy your experience...

1.  Avoid Crucible! it will hurt your brain.

2. Play Gambit, do Raids, and Play the campaigns. Your brain will not hurt as much.

3. Join Discord groups and download the phone app. This way you can find groups and friends to do all sorts of stuff with and get into a Clan. This is the true experience of Destiny 2 IMO, Get a group and kill a few hours or days, and get that light level up!

I don't know if I had an autistic switch or something, but I can't get enough now. It very much feeds my Fallout addiction. 

On to the negatives... I have found that after a certain level enemies become bullet sponges. The difficulty isn't real difficulty. There isn't a challenge. I have also found that some missions were just plain awful (the Raider Rose questline was so long and so boring). In certain areas, lighting sucks ass too. There are probably more problems but I haven't been paying super close attention.

For the positives, It takes place before Fallout 1, so that gives us access to a lot of Lore material. The Pip-Boy is well designed and fairly similar to how I remember it in Fallout 1. I really enjoy the whole America-vibe that is everywhere as well. You get to join The Enclave in some capacity, which is a first for Fallout and a welcome one at that. 

Overall, I would say that this game is a decent play. I would only ever recommend getting it on sale. For those of you who can stand some of the more jarring missions and the rough start, it should be worth it.

90268,4,Thu,Aug,2022,05:21:15,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 is, simply put, the single most underrated FPS video game of all time. An unfortunate set of circumstances prevented the game from rising to the spotlight, including a poorly timed release between two massive competitors (Battlefield and CoD) and more recently a hacking problem (which has since been resolved). 

Titanfall 2 is an FPS based around speed; You can run on walls, double jump, strafe midair, and depending on the equipped kit, grapple to a place (or titan), increase speed and health regen, or many other things. Outside of your titan, you are a god of movement, inside you are a god of strength. But you don't necessarily need to choose between the two; if you exit your titan while it's on the field, your titan will act on its own in one of two modes: guard or follow. It is also the predecessor to Apex Legends, and is set in the same universe.

The gameplay experience is so masterfully crafted that even when you're being beaten mercilessly and are on the bottom of the lobby, you feel invincible. The playerbase is small, and very few people are active anymore, but if you're willing to wait around for five minutes for a match (and maybe some problems getting booted out of the multiplayer menu (it's not a huge issue, honestly, just annoying; you'll never be kicked from a match)) then I'd definitely buy this game. And if you like it, please spread the word; the servers just came back online a few months ago, and if we can build a community again, then it'll make the game so much more fun for everyone and Titanfall 2 can get the glory days it always deserved.",titanfall two is simply put the single most underrated fps video game of all time an unfortunate set of circumstances prevented the game from rising to the spotlight including a poorly timed release between two massive competitors battlefield and cod and more recently a hacking problem which has since been resolved titanfall two is an fps based around speed you can run on walls double jump strafe midair and depending on the equipped kit grapple to a place or titan increase speed and health regen or many other things outside of your titan you are a god of movement inside you are a god of strength but you don t necessarily need to choose between the two if you exit your titan while it s on the field your titan will act on its own in one of two modes guard or follow it is also the predecessor to apex legends and is set in the same universe the gameplay experience is so masterfully crafted that even when you re being beaten mercilessly and are on the bottom of the lobby you feel invincible the playerbase is small and very few people are active anymore but if you re willing to wait around for five minutes for a match and maybe some problems getting booted out of the multiplayer menu it s not a huge issue honestly just annoying you ll never be kicked from a match then i d definitely buy this game and if you like it please spread the word the servers just came back online a few months ago and if we can build a community again then it ll make the game so much more fun for everyone and titanfall two can get the glory days it always deserved,titanfall simply put single underrated fps video game time unfortunate set circumstances prevented game rising spotlight including poorly timed release massive competitors battlefield cod recently hacking problem resolved titanfall fps based run double jump strafe midair depending equipped grapple titan increase health regen things titan god movement inside god strength necessarily choose exit titan titan act modes guard follow predecessor apex legends set universe gameplay experience masterfully crafted beaten mercilessly bottom lobby feel invincible playerbase people active anymore wait minutes match problems booted multiplayer menu huge issue honestly annoying kicked match buy game spread servers online months ago build community make game fun titanfall days deserved,titanfall simply put single underrated fps video game time unfortunate set circumstances prevented game rising spotlight including poorly timed release massive competitors battlefield cod recently hacking problem resolved titanfall fps based run double jump strafe midair depending equipped grapple titan increase health regen things titan god movement inside god strength necessarily choose exit titan titan act modes guard follow predecessor apex legends set universe gameplay experience masterfully crafted beaten mercilessly bottom lobby feel invincible playerbase people active anymore wait minutes match problems booted multiplayer menu huge issue honestly annoying kicked match buy game spread servers online months ago build community make game fun titanfall days deserved,1,1,0.527559042,3,8,-0.45,0.37,1557,293.0,0.13,117.25,293.0,39,106,1.54,2,5.31,106,-0.8868,0

First of all, i really enjoyed the campaign part of the game and i think basically its a great game with some major design flaws. So i want to start with the positive aspects of the game:

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
- nice setting (sci-fi WW1) and certainly an entertaining story.
- good progress rate and you really get the feeling of growing in power by getting better items, skills and talents.
-all four classes offer an individual playstyle and are fun to play.
-three subclasses with detailed skill-trees.
-nice difficulty stystem (similar to the torment-tiers in D3).
-

So right up to lvl 30 the game was super and i was looking forward to the legendary loot and how they alter and enable builds etc. I tried multiple classes and enjoyed all of them and liked the talent system too try different playstyles and approaches (with respeccs for free and an great item customization this is rather easy and very well versed) Up till the end i was expecting a great game, with high replayability. Sadly that is all but true...

[h1] Cons:[/h1]

- server connection is mandatory and was a joke at launch. Getting a green latency in group play is like seeing a unicorn...
-no lobby whatsoever; bring your friends or join some rnd dudes doing stuff you did not want to do or are afk.
-expeditions are miserably balanced; solo they are often pretty challenging, while in group the are just fire and forget sometimes.
-the only goal in expeditions is finishing as fast as possible for great loot. Limiting the game essentially to speedruns.
-no transmog (you do not look as worse as in cyberpunk 2077, but still...).
-linear combat areas.

After you reach Expeditions the game becomes so linear and since the only challenge in all different areas is just to kill a lot of mobs in short succession and as fast as possible build choices are rather limited. This renders most of the Item Sets, Skill trees and legendaries useless. The great world tier system you improve on during the campaign becomes completely obsolete because you only play expeditions for loot (and they use are similar but different tier system).

It definitely had cons that I was expecting but the game is much better than I expected and the cons weren't nearly as bad. Yes, there are occasional spawn issues and server disconnects BUT when it plays well, it plays really well. There are some limiting issues that irritate me such as the inventory space, C.A.M.P. (base building) plot size, and Base building placement errors. That said, the game has still hooked me. I've spent hours building my base and rebuilding it. I'm lvl 68 and JUST started on campaigns. There are a few things at this level that are Rep Grinding, which I loathe entirely, but there is SO much to do in this game. 

Before buying the game I'd heard of a lot of grieving and pvp irritations but since I've put in 100+ hours, I'll tell you I've had ONE player-based issue during the entirety. You can turn on safe mode (or passive mode?) and it makes it where players won't be able to hurt you, and even then, most of them won't even try. 

I tend to go off of a $1/hour of gameplay formula and this game definitely fills that and then some. Fallout first helped that a bit ONLY for the scrapbox factor and private world access. Speaking of, Fallout First does NOT introduce a 'pay to win' concept of the game. Primarily it just adds cosmetics and some minor benefits. You can play without it and still enjoy the game in its entirety without feeling like you're falling behind or missing content. 

So all of that said, I still have complaints but Fallout 76 has become a game that I actually recommend to people now. Regardless of what doubts you've had, at $20 you can easily get your money's worth.

59979,18,Thu,Jun,2020,04:15:38,Fallout 76,"DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS GAME - EVER. Its good for a bit then the stink (from the crap they keep shoving under the carpet)  just gets to much for you. Fallout 76 had a horrible roll out, which is the vast majority of reviews are written in. I didn't start playing until Wastelanders came out. For a 2 year old game, its no were near were it should be. With so many people paying $20 dollars a month so they can protect their junk that literally is everywhere, and respawns all the time. I just don't understand people and their wallets. But beyond the tons of bugs that you encounter in this game (still to this day - you will encounter 3 or 4 bugs a hour in play time- sure glad people who pay $20 a month are seeing that support go to the game -eh?). 

My biggest complaint is this game could be like Destiny 2 with the rich Fallout storyline, instead it feels like everything is just tacked on. PVP in the game? Its a joke, even if you turn pacifist mode on people with bloody build or sneak build with Instigating gun will instantly kill you even if you see them physically the game doesn't compute that your dead before you have a chance to do anything. But you can't get revenge because now your dead and it starts the entire cycle of ""free"" hit all over again. Okay so lets talk about PVP game mode - Nuclear winter - Battle Royal - Destiny 2 has like 5 pvp modes, this game has one that is STILL IN BETA, and actively its better if you just hide and NEVER kill anyone because you get more xp for that? Its pvp? Nope its really just hide and seek. 

I have played every fallout game since the old role play games by interplay. I like the world, Fallout 4 was great as a single player game. Its a shame they took that engine and tacked on multi player and then try to pass it off as a MMO - that needs $20 dollars of support a month to unlock the ability to store leather (a single item in a database - with a integer storage) nope your limited to 800 pounds pay us 20$ so we can support the online gameplay... its all a joke. No matter how many bugs they say they fix there is so many it be best if they start over, maybe now that microsoft owns it now we will see.",do not pay full price for this game ever its good for a bit then the stink from the crap they keep shoving under the carpet just gets to much for you fallout seventy six had a horrible roll out which is the vast majority of reviews are written in i didn t start playing until wastelanders came out for a two year old game its no were near were it should be with so many people paying dollar two0 dollars a month so they can protect their junk that literally is everywhere and respawns all the time i just don t understand people and their wallets but beyond the tons of bugs that you encounter in this game still to this day you will encounter three or four bugs a hour in play time sure glad people who pay dollar two0 a month are seeing that support go to the game eh my biggest complaint is this game could be like destiny two with the rich fallout storyline instead it feels like everything is just tacked on pvp in the game its a joke even if you turn pacifist mode on people with bloody build or sneak build with instigating gun will instantly kill you even if you see them physically the game doesn t compute that your dead before you have a chance to do anything but you can t get revenge because now your dead and it starts the entire cycle of free hit all over again okay so lets talk about pvp game mode nuclear winter battle royal destiny two has like five pvp modes this game has one that is still in beta and actively its better if you just hide and never kill anyone because you get more xp for that its pvp nope its really just hide and seek i have played every fallout game since the old role play games by interplay i like the world fallout four was great as a single player game its a shame they took that engine and tacked on multi player and then try to pass it off as a mmo that needs dollar two0 dollars of support a month to unlock the ability to store leather a single item in a database with a integer storage nope your limited to eight hundred pounds pay us two0 dollar so we can support the online gameplay its all a joke no matter how many bugs they say they fix there is so many it be best if they start over maybe now that microsoft owns it now we will see,pay full game bit stink crap shoving carpet fallout horrible vast majority reviews written start playing wastelanders game people paying two0 dollars protect junk literally respawns time understand people wallets tons bugs encounter game encounter bugs hour play time glad people pay two0 support game eh biggest complaint game fallout storyline feels tacked pvp game joke turn pacifist mode people bloody build sneak build instigating gun instantly kill physically game compute dead revenge dead starts entire cycle hit lets talk pvp game mode nuclear pvp modes game beta actively hide kill xp pvp nope hide seek played fallout game role play games interplay world fallout great single game shame engine tacked multi mmo two0 dollars support unlock ability store leather single item database integer storage nope limited pay two0 support online gameplay joke matter bugs start microsoft owns,pay full game bit stink crap shoving carpet fallout horrible vast majority reviews written start playing wastelanders game people paying two0 dollars protect junk literally respawns time understand people wallets tons bugs encounter game encounter bugs hour play time glad people pay two0 support game eh biggest complaint game fallout storyline feels tacked pvp game joke turn pacifist mode people bloody build sneak build instigating gun instantly kill physically game compute dead revenge dead starts entire cycle hit lets talk pvp game mode nuclear pvp modes game beta actively hide kill xp pvp nope hide seek played fallout game role play games interplay world fallout great single game shame engine tacked multi mmo two0 dollars support unlock ability store leather single item database integer storage nope limited pay two0 support online gameplay joke matter bugs start microsoft owns,0,5,0.569988847,7,23,-0.53,1.0,2187,432.0,0.09,172.84,432.0,37,138,1.37,8,5.06,138,0.9963,0

119179,5,Fri,Feb,2021,01:36:20,Destiny 2,"I have been a follower of the destiny franchise since the dawn of the first game, so I thought of making this review to help new players entering the world of destiny.

First of all, the good. This game has grown with me and made me fall in love with it long ago. The stories, the characters, the combat and the mechanics are absolutely fantastic. But in my opinion, there is something that stands out the most, and really gives the essence of a Bungie game. The Lore. The Destiny universe has some amazing backstories. This is what made me create a strong bond with the characters and their goals. The combat is amazing. With unique weapons, 3 classes and 4 subclasses to choose from, the ways to destroy your enemies become almost limitless. The huge world with interplanetary travel, is something that the game does very well and makes you get very immersed while playing. From the landscapes of ruined Earth, to the cold ice plains of Europa, Destiny does it almost flawlessly. 

When the game released, Activision was the publisher. That was well.... Terrible. Activision really only cares about the money that the game will generate, so they kept bestowing microtransactions that would futher damage the already dying player base at the time. Fortunatly, Bungie managed to cut ties with Activision, furthermore allowing them to shape the game to the communities will. That event effectively saved the game.

Now for the flaws. First of all, the game needs attention. In order to reach higher light levels, obtain exotic and legendary gear, you will have to put effort in the game. In other words, you will need to do some grinding. Also, the game might be free, but Bungie keeps releasing new expansions. Don't get me wrong, most of them are fantastic, but they usually cost an arm and a leg to buy. For instance, the newest expansion ""Beyond Light"" is 40 Euros (Using my currency as reference). Also, for a HUUUGE part of the game (Strikes, Raids, Dungeons) you will rely on other players. There are matchmaking features in the game, but it can be a pain in the ass sometimes, so you will need friends to get the best experience possible (ESPECIALLY raids). Bugs are not very frequent, so you won't have to worry about them. Also, modders are extremely scarce. PVP is also a good experience, but I personally prefer PVE.

Overall, Destiny 2 is an amazing game, with lots of things to discover, kill and admire. I would totally recommend you to try it out, speaking from my 330 hour experience in game.",i have been a follower of the destiny franchise since the dawn of the first game so i thought of making this

the game will generate so they kept bestowing microtransactions that would futher damage the already dying player base at the time fortunatly bungie managed to cut ties with activision furthermore allowing them to shape the game to the communities will that event effectively saved the game now for the flaws first of all the game needs attention in order to reach higher light levels obtain exotic and legendary gear you will have to put effort in the game in other words you will need to do some grinding also the game might be free but bungie keeps releasing new expansions don t get me wrong most of them are fantastic but they usually cost an arm and a leg to buy for instance the newest expansion beyond light is four0 euros using my currency as reference also for a huuuge part of the game strikes raids dungeons you will rely on other players there are matchmaking features in the game but it can be a pain in the ass sometimes so you will need friends to get the best experience possible especially raids bugs are not very frequent so you won t have to worry about them also modders are extremely scarce pvp is also a good experience but i personally prefer pve overall destiny

64296,18,Thu,Nov,2021,20:10:11,Outriders,"Some of the biggest problems with this game came from having to ""Beat a timer"" not the Boss. Which in turn led to players being forced to do enough DPS or get punished, forcing the builds to all homogenize and not have any real decision making. You either had the items for the best builds or you farmed using whatever you had until you did. Grab the minimum amount of mods to survive and the maximum DPS boosting mods and bam thats your build forever.

Now that the timer is gone you just have to survive and eventually beat the dungeon/boss which opens up the floor to building less optimal builds because you like the way they play or it feels right to you. Which is a huge step in the right direction. This and the Tiago changes are just excellent.

There are still clunky things like the +% damage to cc debuffed creatures Ash/Frost you can get a huge +% to frozen targets and it should be outrageously strong, but the boss will enrage so fast it will make your head spin and the debuff will fall off instantly. Making the effective up time of this massive damage boost on the most important mobs only active for maybe 3 seconds in a 1 minute fight? If the debuff was not dispelled after the CC had been shrugged off you wouldn't even use other sets so I'm not sure what they should do about this but it is a waste.",some of the biggest problems with this game came from having to beat a timer not the boss which in turn led to players being forced to do enough dps or get punished forcing the builds to all homogenize and not have any real decision making you either had the items for the best builds or you farmed using whatever you had until you did grab the minimum amount of mods to survive and the maximum dps boosting mods and bam thats your build forever now that the timer is gone you just have to survive and eventually beat the dungeon boss which opens up the floor to building less optimal builds because you like the way they play or it feels right to you which is a huge step in the right direction this and the tiago changes are just excellent there are still clunky things like the percent damage to cc debuffed creatures ash frost you can get a huge percent to frozen targets and it should be outrageously strong but the boss will enrage so fast it will make your head spin and the debuff will fall off instantly making the effective up time of this massive damage boost on the most important mobs only active for maybe three seconds in a one minute fight if the debuff was not dispelled after the cc had been shrugged off you wouldn t even use other sets so i m not sure what they should do about this but it is a waste,biggest problems game beat timer turn led players forced dps punished forcing builds homogenize decision making items builds farmed grab minimum amount mods survive maximum dps boosting mods bam build forever timer survive eventually beat dungeon opens floor building optimal builds play feels huge step direction tiago excellent clunky things percent damage cc debuffed creatures huge percent frozen targets outrageously enrage make spin debuff fall instantly making effective time massive damage boost important mobs active seconds minute fight debuff dispelled cc shrugged sets waste,biggest problems game beat timer turn led players forced dps punished forcing builds homogenize decision making items builds farmed grab minimum amount mods survive maximum dps boosting mods bam build forever timer survive eventually beat dungeon opens floor building optimal builds play feels huge step direction tiago excellent clunky things percent damage cc debuffed creatures huge percent frozen targets outrageously enrage make spin debuff fall instantly making effective time massive damage boost important mobs active seconds minute fight debuff dispelled cc shrugged sets waste,1,0,0.0,7,10,-0.18,0.57,1320,253.0,0.11,101.24,253.0,27,84,1.4,1,5.21,84,0.9431,2

63226,1,Wed,Dec,2021,05:38:27,Outriders,"To preface this review I mostly played this game at launch and haven't played much since so I have no idea how many of the bugs and online issues I mention are still present. 

In terms of plot and setting this game is Mad Max meets Mass Effect basically. The plot itself isn't bad, post apocalyptic sci fi setting on an alien world with slightly above average voice acting, but it isn't anything to write home about. Mankind tries to settle on a new world after the Earth goes kaput because reasons, everything seems fine at first but then sci-fi space magic happens and everything goes sideways. It isn't a terrible plot by shooter standards, the writing and acting are serviceable, but the lack of choices makes it fall flat as an RPG. The story is completely on rails with no player impact on how it progresses, none of the quests you get have any significantly different outcomes, ""decisions"" in dialogue don't matter and there are never any long term repercussions for them. While I compare it to Mass Effect that is mostly due to the gameplay not due any kind of comparisons with ME's narrative structure

Speaking of gameplay, many people compare Outriders to Destiny because it is a looter shooter and every looter shooter gets compared to destiny or borderlands at some point, but the combat mechanics are more similar to Mass Effect. Combat is third person and uses a sticky cover system like ME, but gameplay rewards a more aggressive play style as you need to damage enemies in order to heal yourself. Different classes have different restrictions on the range at which they can trigger their heal effect, so the Technomancer and the Pyromancer can trigger their heal effect from any distance, but the Devastator and Trickster have to be up close and personal. Every class has its own unique passive skill tree as well as active abilities that they gain through leveling up. The abilities you get are basically space magic, Technomancers pull random turrets and bombs out of nowhere, Tricksters teleport around and slow down time, etc. The powers are kind of... underwhelming to be honest. You get eight of them throughout the game and generally only about half of them per class are worth bothering with. Level doesn't affect their range or AOE, only their damage, so many of the abilities have the same tiny AOEs at endgame as they did when you got the power. The secondary effects of many of the powers also don't trigger very often, or ever in some cases, especially the debuffs. For instance every class has at least one ability that in theory is supposed to be able to interrupt an enemy that is attempting to use an ability, but the interrupt effect basically never works and some of the skills (e.g., Pain Launcher) that are ostensibly supposed to interrupt, take so long to set up and actually hit the enemy that they will have already finished casting their spell by the time they get ""interrupted."" You can increase the utility of your abilities by equipping gear mods that modify the functionality of certain skills, some mods just apply a percentage increase to damage or range but others actually modify how a certain power behaves or adds a new feature to one.

The two most annoying things about the combat are the restriction on only having three skills at a time and the buggy cover system. Having three skills is particularly annoying if you are playing one of the classes with an ammo power (any class but devastator). Ammo powers are sustained abilities that are extremely powerful but only last one or two magazines, however there are a ridiculous number of gear mods that allow you to instantly refill ammo on your weapons under certain conditions, circumventing the magazine limit and allowing you to essentially keep the power active constantly. Choosing to do this then means you are taking up one of your three power slots with a power that is essentially a passive ability leaving you only two slots for active powers. The buggy cover system can sometimes get you killed, instead of manually leaving one piece of cover, moving and then manually entering another piece of cover, the game lets you use hotkeys to automatically dash from one piece of cover to another, but it frequently bugs out and has you dash from cover only to find yourself on the wrong side of the thing you were aiming for.

I don't really have much to say about Multiplayer as I mostly played this at launch when the servers were overloaded and haven't played much since, so I don't know if the matchmaking issues are still present. At the time I was almost completely unable to join or host a co-op game. The one time I did have a multiplayer experience in this game it was by accident, I had forgotten that I had left that setting on and some rando joined my game while I was farming an old boss. The game features a rewind mechanic where you can reset the main story to any chapter you have already beaten, allowing you to repeatedly farm bosses and areas, unfortunately the only way to change my progress back to the current chapter was to exit to the main menu and change it there, which would end the multiplayer session leaving me in the position of having to kick this person who just joined or having to play through the next five chapters that I had already cleared. I imagine the server issues are probably improved the latter issue comes down to a game design decision and I doubt can be remedied.

The most innovative thing this game does for the looter shooter genre is the idea of world tiers, which remind me a bit of the world tendency system from Demon's Souls. As you kill enemies and level up you will also level up your world tier. Once you gain a higher tier (it starts at 1 and goes all the way to 15) you can choose to play at the new tier. Each tier unlocks harder enemies but also increases not just the quantity of loot but more importantly the quality of loot. At low tier levels the vast majority of loot is white (common), green (uncommon) and occasionally blue (rare). At higher levels white and green items are extremely rare with most loot being blue or purple (epic) with orange (legendary) items dropping occasionally, but at higher tiers the game also becomes prohibitively difficult without a co-op partner. Overall however it is a refreshing approach that minimizes the amount of time you are forced to spend repeatedly farming the same enemies over and over again for the 1 in 10,000 chance that you will get something valuable. It is especially nice in combination with the gear breakdown system that allows you to take gear you don't need and break it down for raw materials and more importantly to unlock its mods. Once you have a particular mod unlocked you can apply that mod to any appropriate piece of gear. This even applies to legendary items, so that lv 5 legendary that you got from the first boss can be broken down and have its ""legendariness"" applied to some other item, or you can spend titanium in order to level it up so it stays relevant throughout the game.

Overall it is an okay game, with a decent if linear plot but mediocre and haphazard gameplay, and other than the world tier system and a simple yet functional crafting system it doesn't do all that much to stand out.",to preface this review i mostly played this game at launch and haven t played much since so i have no idea how many of the bugs and online issues i mention are still present in

I love fallout 4 and think its a great game, but they took elements and changed or didn't change them in a negative way. The game is not fun. I feel like the story line is BS.

It was so revolutionary at the time that Activision crapped their pants and Call of Duty had wallrunning and futuristic settings for years after Titanfall's release (what makes this even funnier is that Respawn Entertainment was created by former Infinity Ward developers that got tired of Activision's mistreatment of them so they left). Then came Titanfall 1 and 2. This game's campaign is super fun and the multiplayer is super faced-paced which is how I like it. Just waiut for a sale and get the game for $5 it is WELL worth the money. I recommend this game to anybody, but especially Apex fans that have never experienced the roots that Apex grew from, and thus don't have a reverence for the games that came before it.

Notes: 
- Multiplayer no longer works in the base game due to Respawn's negligence after joining EA (they should have known better after coming from an abusive company). This is very easy to fix however as you just have to install the fan-made Northstar Client and then it works perfectly! :D

- If your audio is stuck on 7.1 Surround in the game just add ""-channels 2"" (without the parenthesis) to the Steam launch settings and that fixes it.

With the news coming out today that yet another game is going in the ""nerf the good, don't buff the bad"" route i can no longer actually advise anyone to buy this game. This game has so much potential but the way the devs are handling issues and exploits is not  the correct action for me personally. The main story line and side quests were already seemingly dead content once you reached expeditions but there was at least some stuff you could do to make progression. As of this current update i don't see any reason not to rush through the campaign on WT1 and then only focus on expeditions. I was hoping they would create more worthwhile content for the main story and side missions since you can only get up to level 42 gear which is quickly abandoned when expedition rushing and most of the gear is not worth while to upgrade along the way due to heavy resource costs. I truly hope for this game to succeed but with the way it has been handled so far i fear the playerbase will be next to non existent within a month or two.

74352,11,Sun,Apr,2021,20:31:16,Outriders,"Update: The DLC is not worth the asking price.
The content given is repetitive without properly incentivizing any engagement after the novelty wears off. There is basically no randomization in what is supposed to have the replayability of a roguelite. Inacceptable. My verdict, sadly, stands.


The premise of the game is good.
As a looter shooter, it has everything it needs. Fun gunplay, engaging itemization, challenging content.

BUT

The game suffers from the same inexcusable cut corners like many other games suffer from these days: 

On one hand, the game is always online (enforced!) and offloads data onto a server quite often, apparently to prevent ""cheating"".
On the other hand, its database seems to be in a state of ""hot mess, please burn"" so that people's inventory get wiped.

On one hand, it has a fast paced, drop in/out gameplay.
On the other hand, its netcode is yet another unreliable, laggy mess because the game is of course P2P based so that each session is a gamble of latency and host stability.

Combine these factors and you have a multiplayer looter shooter where your loot can vanish out of the blue because their always online policy doesnt work. And stuff desyncs so hard, that you basically can only blind fire because their netcode is not resilient enough.

Verdict: UNPLAYABLE until fixed. And I mean fixed. Not ""bandaid patched"".

EDIT: After testing out the New Horizon update, I sadly have to stick to my verdict. The game still suffers from most of the same issues. The database seems to have been sorted out and the added QoL is nice, but the p2p nature of the multiplayer makes it still a less than enjoyable experience.",update the dlc is not worth the asking price the content given is repetitive without properly incentivizing any engagement after the novelty wears off there is basically no randomization in what is supposed to have the replayability of a roguelite inacceptable my verdict sadly stands the premise of the game is good as a looter shooter it has everything it needs fun gunplay engaging itemization challenging content but the game suffers from the same inexcusable cut corners like many other games suffer from these days on one hand the game is always online enforced and offloads data onto a server quite often apparently to prevent cheating on the other hand its database seems to be in a state of hot mess please burn so that people s inventory get wiped on one hand it has a fast paced drop in out gameplay on the other hand its netcode is yet another unreliable laggy mess because the game is of course p2p based so that each session is a gamble of latency and host stability combine these factors and you have a multiplayer looter shooter where your loot can vanish out of the blue because their always online policy doesnt work and stuff desyncs so hard that you basically can only blind fire because their netcode is not resilient enough verdict unplayable until fixed and i mean fixed not bandaid patched edit after testing out the new horizon update i sadly have to stick to my verdict the game still suffers from most of the same issues the database seems to have been sorted out and the added qol is nice but the p2p nature of the multiplayer makes it still a less than enjoyable experience,update dlc content repetitive properly incentivizing engagement novelty wears basically randomization supposed replayability roguelite inacceptable verdict sadly stands premise game looter shooter fun gunplay engaging itemization challenging content game suffers inexcusable cut corners games suffer days game online enforced offloads data server apparently prevent cheating database hot mess burn people inventory wiped paced drop gameplay netcode unreliable laggy mess game p2p based session latency host stability combine factors multiplayer looter shooter loot vanish online policy doesnt work stuff desyncs hard basically blind fire netcode resilient verdict unplayable fixed fixed bandaid patched edit testing horizon update sadly stick verdict game suffers issues database sorted added qol nice p2p nature multiplayer makes enjoyable experience,update dlc content repetitive properly incentivizing engagement novelty wears basically randomization supposed replayability roguelite inacceptable verdict sadly stands premise game looter shooter fun gunplay engaging itemization challenging content game suffers inexcusable cut corners games suffer days game online enforced offloads data server apparently prevent cheating database hot mess burn people inventory wiped paced drop gameplay netcode unreliable laggy mess game p2p based session latency host stability combine factors multiplayer looter shooter loot vanish online policy doesnt work stuff desyncs hard basically blind fire netcode resilient verdict unplayable fixed fixed bandaid patched edit testing horizon update sadly stick verdict game suffers issues database sorted added qol nice p2p nature multiplayer makes enjoyable experience,0,3,0.523990691,10,19,-0.31,0.97,1602,284.0,0.17,113.67,284.0,47,112,1.67,4,5.64,112,0.9908,0

The story revolves you being someone that has a lot of power and it delivers this through the design of combat as well. Also doesn't strap you into a grind of gear constantly.
